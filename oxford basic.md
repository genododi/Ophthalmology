# The skull

- The skull is divided into two groups of bones:
  - those that define the cranium
  - those that define the face.
- The cranium itself is divided into the vault and the base of the skull.

- There are six bones that constitute the cranium:
  - frontal
  - parietal (paired)
  - occipital
  - temporal (paired)
  - sphenoid
  - ethmoid.

- The following are the eight bones that constitute the facial bones:
  - zygomatic (paired)
  - maxillae (paired)
  - nasal (paired)
  - lacrimal (paired)
  - vomer
  - palatine (paired)
  - inferior conchae (paired)
  - mandible.

# Lateral aspect of the skull

## Structure

- The frontal bones form the anterior part of the side of the skull and articulate with the parietal bone at the coronal suture.
- The parietal bones form the side and roof of the cranium and articulate with each other in the midline at the sagittal suture. They articulate with the occipital bone at the lambdoid suture.
- The side of the skull is completed by the squamous part of the occipital bone, parts of the temporal bone (in particular the squamous, tympanic, mastoid process, styloid process, and zygomatic process), and the greater wing of the sphenoid.
- The thinnest area of the lateral wall of the skull is known as the pterion. It resides at the unison between the parietal bone and the greater wing of the sphenoid. The pterion is essentially the lateral bony housing for the anterior division of the middle meningeal artery and vein within the cranial cavity. Blows or fractures of the pterion have been known to rupture these vessels, leading to significant haemorrhage.
- The temporal fossa lies between the temporal lines (which are an extension of the posterior curve of the frontozygomatic ridge) and the infratemporal crest of the greater wing of sphenoid (above the zygomatic arch).
- The inferotemporal fossa lies beneath the infratemporal crest on the greater wing of sphenoid.
- The pterygomaxillary fissure is a vertical fissure that lies within the fossa between the pterygoid process of the sphenoid bone and the maxilla.
  - This fissure transmits the terminal part of the maxillary artery and alveolar branches of the maxillary nerve. It leads medially into the pterygopalatine fossa, which is a small triangular cavity behind and below the apex of the orbital cavity. It communicates:
    - laterally with the infratemporal fossa (through the pterygomaxillary fissure)
    - medially with the nasal cavity (through the sphenopalatine foramen)
    - superiorly with the skull (through the foramen rotundum)
    - anteriorly with the orbit (through the inferior orbital fissure (IOF)).

- The pterygopalatine fossa contains the pterygopalatine ganglion (suspended by nerve roots from the maxillary nerve), the second branch of the maxillary nerve (V2), the nerve of the pterygoid canal (a continuation of the facial nerve and carrying parasympathetic fibres), and the terminal third of the maxillary artery.

## The frontal bone

- The frontal bone forms the curve of the forehead. It articulates medially with the nasal bones and the frontal processes of the maxilla. The frontal bones articulate laterally with the zygomatic bone and posteriorly with both parietal bones. Within the frontal bone itself are the two hollow spaces lined with mucous membrane, the frontal air sinuses.

## The maxillary bones

- The maxillary bones exist as a pair. They join medially to form:
  - the upper jaw
  - the anterior part of the hard palate (the posterior is formed by the palatine bone)
  - a contribution to the lateral wall of the nasal cavity
  - part of the orbital floor.

- Within the maxillary bones lie the maxillary sinuses. These sinuses also share a close relationship with the orbital floor in both eyes. In the event of maxillary sinusitis, it is possible that infection may spread through the floor of the orbit into the orbit itself to give rise to orbital cellulitis.

## The zygoma

- The zygoma articulates medially with the maxilla and laterally with the zygomatic process of the temporal bone to give rise to the zygomatic arch. Superiorly the zygoma interacts with frontal bone at the fronto-zygomatic suture. Here, these two bones make up the lateral orbital rim.

- Each zygoma contains two foramina. They house:

- zygomaticofacial nerves
- zygomaticotemporal nerves.

## Orbital margins

- The orbital margin/rim is a quadrilateral spiral structure and is bound by several bones.

# The nasal apparatus

- Anteriorly, two nasal bones form the bridge of the nose. These nasal bones are the superior boundaries to the opening of the nasal cavity (the anterior nasal aperture). Inferiorly and laterally, the boundaries of the nasal aperture are formed by the maxillae.
- The nasal cavity is bisected by the nasal septum, which is mostly formed by the vomer (the bony extension of the nasal septum). On the lateral walls of the cavity lie the conchae. There are three sets of conchae to each lateral wall. The superior and middle conchae extend from the ethmoid. The inferior conchae are separate bones and extend from the maxilla.

# Superior aspect of the skull

- Superiorly, the frontal bone unites with the two parietal bones at the coronal suture.
- The sagittal suture is formed between the two parietal bones.

# Inferior aspect of the skull

- The two maxillae form the upper jaw, the anterior part of the hard palate, part of the lateral walls of the nasal cavities, and part of the fl oor of the orbital cavities. The two maxillary bones join in the midline to form the intermaxillary suture, which forms the lower margin of the nasal aperture.

- The palatal processes of the maxillae and the horizontal plates of the palatine bones can be identifi ed. Anteriorly in the midline, the incisive fossa and foramen can be seen. Posterolaterally are the greater and lesser palatine foramina.

- Above the posterior edge of the hard palate, the choanae (posterior nasal apertures) can be seen. These are separated medially by the vomer and laterally by the medial pterygoid plates of the sphenoid bone. Posterolateral to the lateral pterygoid plate lie the foramen ovale and the foramen spinosum.

# Posterior aspect of the skull

- The lambdoid suture is formed by the unison of (the squamous part of the) occipital bone and both parietal bones.
- In the midline of the occipital bone, there is an elevation called the external occipital protuberance and the occipital crest. From this, there arise attachments to muscles and to the ligamentum nuchae

# Superior surface of the base of the skull

## The anterior cranial fossa

- The ACF houses the frontal lobes of the cerebral hemispheres. It is bound anteriorly and anterolaterally by the frontal bone.
- The posterior border is marked by the lesser wing of sphenoid. The medial part of the lesser wing of sphenoid forms the anterior clinoid process. The floor of the ACF is bound by cribriform plates of the ethmoid medially and the ridged orbital plates of the frontal bone laterally
- Medially, the crista galli is a sharp upward projection of the ethmoid bone, for the attachment of the falx cerebri.

## The middle cranial fossa

- The lesser wing of the sphenoid and the anterior margin of the sulcus chiasmatis bind the MCF anteriorly. Other anterior boundary structures are the anterior clinoid processes, which overhang the MCF and form attachments with the free edge of the tentorium cerebelli.
- The posterior border is formed by the petrous temporal bones. The posterior border also contains the posterior clinoid processes to which the attached edge of the tentorium cerebelli are fixed.
- The lateral boundaries are formed by the squamous parts of the temporal bone, the greater wings of the sphenoid, and a small portion of the parietal bones.

## The posterior cranial fossa

- The PCF is the deepest of the cranial fossa. The ridge of the petrous portion of the temporal bone forms the anterior boundary of the PCF.
- The posterior border of the PCF occurs at the internal surface of the squamous portion of the occipital bone.
- The roof of the fossa is formed by the tentorium cerebelli. The floor consists of the basilar and squamous portions of the occipital bone coupled with temporal bone (mastoid portion) laterally.

# The meninges

- The brain and spinal cord are surrounded by three membranes or meninges:

  - the dura mater
  - the arachnoid mater
  - the pia mater.

- In the midline of the occipital bone, there is an elevation called the external occipital protuberance and the occipital crest. From this, there arise attachments to muscles and to the ligamentum nuchae.

- The endosteum does not extend through the foramen magnum to remain continuous with the dura mater of the spinal cord. It does, however, become continuous with the periosteum around the skull.
- The dura mater is continuous through the foramen magnum and remains continuous with the dura mater of the spinal cord.
- Inside the skull, the meningeal layer sends up four septa, which divide the cranial cavity into freely communicating spaces. These septa prevent rotator displacement of the cranial contents. They are as follows:
  - The falx cerebri—this is a sickle-shaped fold of dura mater that lies in the midline between the two cerebral hemispheres. Its narrow frontal end is attached to the crista galli and its broad posterior end is attached to the upper surface of the tentorium cerebella. The superior saggital sinus runs in its upper fixed margin and the inferior saggital sinus runs in its lower free margin. The straight sinus runs in its inferior attachment to the tentorium cerebella.
  - The tentorium cerebelli—this is a crescent-shaped fold of dura mater that lies over the upper surface of the cerebellum and provides support for the occipital lobes of the cerebral hemispheres. Anteriorly, there is a notch—the tentorial notch—for the passage of the midbrain.
  - The falx cerebelli—this is a small fold of dura mater that is attached to the internal occipital crest and passes between the two cerebellar hemispheres.
  - The diaphragm sellae—this is a small fold of dura mater that forms the roof of the sella turcica. There is a small opening in the centre for passage of the stalk of the hypophysis cerebri.

- The dura mater is sensitive to stretch, producing the sensation of headache, because of its innervations by the trigeminal, vagus, and first three cervical nerves as well as branches from the sympathetic system. The dura has a number of arteries that supply it. The most important is the middle meningeal artery, which arises from the maxillary artery in the infratemporal fossa. It passes through the foramen spinosum and passes along the squamous part of the temporal bone, lying between the meningeal and endosteal layers of the dura. It may be damaged in head injuries, especially to the temporal area.
- The arachnoid mater acts as an impermeable membrane. It is separated from the dura by the subdural space and from the pia by the subarachnoid space, which is filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In certain areas, the arachnoid projects as arachnoid granulations into the venous sinuses. These are the sites at which the CSF drains into the bloodstream. The arachnoid mater is attached to the pia mater across the fluid-filled subarachnoid space by fine strands of fibrous tissue. All structures passing through, both to and from the brain, must pass through the subarachnoid space. All the cerebral arteries, veins, and cranial nerves lie in this space. The optic nerve is surrounded by a sheath of arachnoid mater that extends into the orbital cavity.
- Pia mater is a vascular membrane that covers the surface of the brain. It also covers and gives a sheath to the arteries and cranial nerves.
- CSF removes waste products of neuronal activity and provides a medium in which the brain is bathed, thus protecting it from trauma. It is produced by the choroidal plexuses in the lateral, third, and fourth ventricles of the brain. It leaves the ventricular system of the brain through foramina in the roof of the fourth ventricle. From here, it circulates upwards over the surface of the cerebral hemispheres and downwards over the spinal cord. The spinal subarachnoid space extends down to the second sacral vertebra.

# The venous sinuses of the cranial cavity

- The venous sinuses lie within the layers of the dura mater. The sinus walls do not contain a muscular layer but do comprise an endothelial layer.
- The superior sagittal sinus lies medially and takes up the fixed, superior border of the falx cerebri. It originates from an anterior direction starting above the foramen caecum to move backwards towards the internal occipital protruberance. Here it is redirected horizontally to the right (usually) to give the transverse sinus. The superior sagittal sinus constitutes the major venous drainage site from middle and posterior portions of the two cerebral hemispheres.
- The inferior sagittal sinus lies parallel and deep to the superior sagittal sinus. It lies medially within the free folds of the falx cerebri and consequently drains the lower portions of the medial cerebral hemispheres. The inferior sagittal sinus drains into the straight sinus, which resides in the junction of the tentorium cerebelli and the falx cerebri. At this junction the straight sinus receives the two basilar veins and the cerebral vein of Galen, after which the straight sinus becomes continuous with the left (usually) transverse sinus. The tranverse sinuses reflect forward within the attached margins of the tentorium cerebelli.
- The transverse sinuses receive blood from the superior petrosal sinuses, and inferior cerebral and cerebellar veins. On each side, the transverse sinuses tip downwards to become the right and left sigmoid sinuses, respectively. In turn, the right and left sigmoid sinuses continue forwards into the superior bulb of the internal jugular vein. The jugular veins exit the cranial cavity via the jugular foramen.

# Central nervous system

## Neuroanatomy

### Major features

- The two cerebral hemispheres are incompletely separated by the great longitudinal fissure. This is normally filled by the falx cerebri. Deep between the two hemispheres lies the corpus callosum, which contains commissural fibres that unite corresponding areas of the two hemispheres. The brainstem is the site of origin of the cranial nerves. Behind (dorsal) to the brainstem lies the cerebellum. The cerebellum is separated from the occipital lobes above by the tentorium cerebelli.

## Ventricular system

- The various compressions and developments from the neural canal create a network of cavities within the central nervous system known as the ventricular system (Fig. 1.8).
- The ventricular system is the site of production of CSF, which is secreted by the choroid plexus.
- The choroid plexus, which produces the vast majority (70%) of CSF, is formed from a combination of ependymal cells (these line the ventricular system), the pia mater, and capillaries. Other cerebral capillaries form the remaining 30%.
- The ventricular system is made up of four cerebral ventricles:
  - the paired lateral ventricles
  - the midline third ventricle
  - and, below the third, the fourth ventricle.

- The two lateral ventricles, located within each cerebral hemisphere, are the largest of the four ventricles. They are C-shaped and lie loosely around the dorsal aspects of the basal ganglia.
  - Both of the lateral ventricles extend into the frontal, occipital, and temporal lobes via the anterior, posterior, and temporal horns, respectively.
  - The lateral ventricles both exchange CSF via the interventricular foramina of Monro with the third ventricle.
- The third ventricle is found along the midline within the diencephalon. It is situated within the midbrain and communicates via the cerebral aqueduct of Sylvius with the fourth ventricle, which is located within the hindbrain.
- The three foramina to the subarachnoid space are found within the fourth ventricle:
  - medially—the foramen of Magendie, leading to the cerebellomedullary cistern of lateral ventricle.
  - laterally—the two (left and right) foramen of Luschka, leading to the pontine cistern.

- This permits CSF produced in the ventricles to escape into the subarachnoid space to bathe the brainstem, cerebellum, and cerebral cortex.
- The fourth ventricle is also continuous with the central canal of the spinal cord, allowing CSF to bathe the spinal cord from within.
  - Anterior horn of lateral ventricle  
  - Body of lateral ventricle Interventricular foramen  
  - Posterior horn of lateral ventricle  
  - Third ventricle Inferior horn  
  - Cerebral aqueduct  
  - Fourth ventricle  

## Relations of the ventricles

- The caudate nucleus lies beneath the C-shaped concavity on each of the lateral ventricles. The head of the caudate nucleus lies next to the anterior horn, whereas the tail curves backwards and down before reflecting forward to form part of the roof of the inferior horn of the lateral ventricle.
- The thalamus is situated inferiorly and medial to the caudate nucleus. The thalamus is the largest structure in the diencephalons and is located on top of the brainstem in a position to send nerve fibres out to the cerebral cortex. The two halves of the thalamus are prominent bulb-shaped masses, located symmetrically on the lateral walls of the third ventricle.
- The thalamus is related to the following structures:
  - the floor of the body of the lateral ventricles
  - the roof of the inferior horn of the lateral ventricles.

- The hypothalamus is located below the thalamus, just above the brainstem and behind the pituitary stalk. The superior surface of the hypothalamus forms the floor of the third ventricle. The groove in the lateral wall of the third ventricle demarcates the thalamus–hypothalamus junction.
- The floor of the fourth ventricle denotes a landmark for several structures, including the sixth and seventh nerve nuclei.

## Brainstem

- Ascending and descending fibres that pass between the brain and spinal cord pass through the brainstem. It is the site of origin of many cranial nerves (discussed below) and is also responsible for controlling vital cardiovascular and respiratory function.

## Cerebellum

### Functions

- The cerebellum is responsible for maintenance of equilibrium, posture, and muscle tone, and coordinates movement. It is composed of two laterally located hemispheres, joined in the midline by the vermis. The superior surface lies under the tentorium cerebelli. It is attached to the brainstem by fibres that lie laterally to the fourth ventricle on both sides. These fibres are split into three parts:
  - inferior peduncle
  - middle peduncle
  - superior cerebellar peduncle.

- These carry nerve fibres between the medulla, pons, and midbrain. The cerebellum consists of an outer layer of grey matter (the cerebellar cortex) and a central core of white matter. The surface is convoluted into a regular pattern of folia or parallel folds. The white matter consists of fibres that run to and from the cerebellar cortex.

### Afferents of the cerebellum

- Afferents originate in the spinal cord (spinocerebellar tracts), inferior olivary nucleus (spino-olivary tracts), vestibular nuclei (vestibule-cerebellar tracts), and pons (ponto-cerebellar tracts). Afferent axons travel through one of the cerebellar peduncles and terminate in the cerebellar cortex.
- There are two main groups of cerebellar afferents:
  - climbing fibres
  - mossy fibres.

- The vast majority of climbing fibres start from the contralateral inferior olivary nucleus. These fibres insert into the cerebellum through the inferior cerebellar peduncle and give rise to excitatory synapses with the Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex.
- The inferior olivary nucleus accepts afferents from:
  - cortical fibres
  - spinal fibres
  - vestibulorecticular fibres
  - red nucleus fibres
  - the superior colliculus
  - the interstitial nucleus of Cajal.

- The largest provider of cerebellar afferents comes from the contralateral pontine nuclei via the mossy fibres. These contralateral fibres pass through the middle cerebellar peduncle to reach the granular layer of the cerebellum. The reason why the pontine nuclei contain so many afferent fibres is probably due to its inputs. It receives cerebral information from the motor and somatosensory regions as well as the visual association cortex.
- Information regarding proprioception is conveyed to the cerebellum via two main pathways:
    1. the dorsal spinocerebellar tracts
    2. the ventral spinocerebellar tracts.

- The dorsal spinocerebellar tracts take their origin in the nucleus dorsalis, which lies in the thoracic and lumber areas lower down the spinal cord. These fibres run ipsilaterally through the spine and insert into the cerebellum via the inferior peduncle. This track carries data on proprioreception from the legs and lower trunk.
- The upper limb equivalent of the dorsal spinocerebellar tract is the cuneocerebellar tract, which gives proprioreceptive data from the upper limbs, the upper trunk, and the neck.
- The ventral spinocerebellar tracts have nuclei situated within the thoracic spine, usually at or below T4–5. In comparison to the dorsal counterpart, these fibres decussate twice, once at the immediate level within the spine and again just before entering the cerebellum through the superior peduncle. The main purpose of this tract is to relay data concerning the afferent limbs of the withdrawal reflexes and the state of the spinal cord. As with the dorsal spinocerebellar tracts the ventral spinocerebellar tracts convey information on one half of the body, in this case the lower half. The equivalent upper half is maintained by the rostral spinocerebellar tracts.
- In terms of evolution, the oldest area within the cerebellum is the floculonodular node. This receives afferents from the ipsilateral vestibular nuclei (via the inferior peduncle) and naturally relays information regarding balance and eye movements.

### Cerebellar efferents

- The functions of the efferents in the cerebellum are concerned with posture, balance, and fine muscle control.
- There are no direct connections between the cerebellar nuclei and the spinal cord or the cranial nerves. These nuclei instead influence smooth coordination via a complicated process of feed back and feed forward systems.
- There are three main groups of cerebellar efferents:
  - the vermal and floculonodular efferent system
  - the paraventral efferents
  - the lateral zone of the cerebellar cortex.

- The vermal and floculonodular efferent system begins with fibres originating from the Purkinje cells in the mid-cerebellum travelling to the fastigial nuclei. Coordination, posture, balance, and vestibular eye movements are all dependent on this system.
- The paraventral efferents are thought to be involved with fine-tuning initiated movements and predominantly affect the movement of flexor muscle groups.
- The lateral zone of the cerebellar cortex contributes to the preparation of rapid and skilled voluntary muscle movement. These axons, which aim for the thalamus, travel via the superior cerebellar peduncle. The vast majority of the thalamic fibres end up in the nucleus ventralis lateralis, which then passes on information to the premotor cortex.

## Cerebral hemispheres

- Rostral to the brainstem is the forebrain, which consists of the diencephalon and cerebral hemispheres. The two sides of the diencephalon are separated by the lumen of the third ventricle, whose lateral walls they constitute. The thalamus is the largest (of four) part of the diencephalon, forming a major part of the wall of the third ventricle. The hypothalamus is also part of the diencephalon and this forms part of the lower wall of the third ventricle. The pituitary gland arises from the hypothalamus and is attached to it by the infundibulum or pituitary stalk.
- The cerebral hemispheres are the largest part of the brain, and consist of a cortex and an inner mass of white matter. Buried within the white matter are several large masses called basal ganglia. The hemispheres are separated by the great longitudinal fissure, which accommodates the falx cerebri. At the base of the fissure lies the corpus callosum, which is a mass of commissural fibres that run transversely and link corresponding areas of the two cerebral cortices.
- The cerebral cortex has convolutions (gyri) and furrows (sulci). Particular gyri and sulci are constant features, common to every human brain, which have specific functions (Fig. 1.9a).
- The frontal lobe is demarcated posteriorly by the central sulcus and inferiorly by the lateral fissure. Posterior to the central sulcus is the parietal lobe. The posterior part of the parietal and temporal lobe is the occipital lobe, ending in the occipital pole. This boundary can be seen only on sagittal section (Fig. 1.9b).
- In the frontal lobe, the gyrus in front of the central sulcus is the precentral gyrus. This contains the primary motor cortex. It receives inputs from the cerebellum and the thalamus. The primary motor cortex contains a somatotopic representation of the different body parts called a motor homunculus (Latin for 'little man'). With the exception of the face (which is upright), the body is represented upside down, and the hand, having a relatively large representation, is found above the face followed by the arm, torso, and leg. The supplementary motor

### Frontal eye fields

- The frontal eye fields lie in front of the premotor cortex in the middle frontal gyrus, on the lateral surface of the hemisphere (Brodmann's area 8). They are associated with:
  - voluntary eye movement
  - the accommodation pathway.

- Damage to this area causes conjugate deviation of the eyes toward the side of the lesion.
- This saccadic movement is a fast eye movement. It may be compared with the quick phase of nystagmus, which is an involuntary fast saccade. The quick phase of nystagmus has been shown to originate at the paramedian pontine reticular formation (PPRF).
- The mechanisms that intiate, allow, and control voluntary smooth pursuit are less well understood. Smooth pursuit is thought to be initiated at the parieto-occipital-temporal junction, where fibres travel down to terminate in the ipsilateral PPRF.
- The vestibular nuclei of the vestibulo-cochlear system also have connections with the contralateral PPRF. This creates slow eye movements in the opposite direction of the side in which the horizontal canal is stimulated.

### Supranuclear gaze pathways

- The frontal eye fields and cells within the superior colliculus are thought to be the orignators of saccades. These are rapid eye movements that occur when a person wishes to switch quickly from one target to another.
- The fibres (fronto-mesencephalic pathway) from this area travel within the anterior limb of the internal capsule to pass though the thalamus before decussating at the level of the lower midbrain to terminate at the contralateral PPRF, otherwise known as the horizontal gaze centre. There are two PPRFs, which lie lateral to each sixth nerve nuclei and act as functional centres responsible for horizontal eye movements. They act as a final common pathway for conjugate horizontal movements initiated by higher centres, including:
  - quick phase of nystagmus
  - coordination of saccadic movements
  - smooth pursuit movements
  - vestibular nuclei-related smooth movements.

- The right PPRF mediates conjugate horizontal movements to the right, and vice versa, by coordinating the nuclei of cranial nerves III, IV, and VI (Fig. 1.10).
- Fibres from the PPRF relay with the ipsilateral sixth nerve nuclei.
- One cell group within the sixth nerve nuclei controls the lateral rectus.
- The second cell group has fibres that travel within the contralateral medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) to reach the subdivision of the third nerve nuclei, which controls the contralateral medial rectus.
- The MLF is a tract of fibres that travel the length of the midbrain and pons. These include connections between the three ocular motor nuclei (CN III, IV, and VI) and area is situated medially on the surface of the frontal lobe just in front of the primary motor cortex. This area is associated with postural mechanisms (Fig. 1.9).
- In the parietal lobe, the postcentral gyrus (or primary somatosensory cortex) is the site of termination of pathways that carry sensation, i.e. pain, pressure, temperature, and touch, from the opposite side of the body. The special senses have their own representation in other areas and these are served by the cranial nerves (Fig. 1.9).
- The visual field is represented in the occipital lobe. The organization of this will be detailed much more thoroughly (Fig. 1.9 and pp. 26–7).
- Afferent and efferent fibres which pass between the cerebral cortex and subcortical structures, e.g. brainstem, thalamus, spinal cord are arranged in a regular pattern (corona radiata). Deeper inside the hemisphere, the fibres are arranged in a dense sheet of white matter, known as the internal capsule.
- The fibres of the optic radiation are some of the most posterior fibres of the internal capsule. They run horizontally and posterior to the lentiform nucleus.
- Inside the cortex lie masses of grey matter (basal ganglia), the largest of which is the corpus striatum. These are responsible for muscle tone, posture, and movement.

### Broca's area (Brodmann's area 44 and 45)

- This is located on the inferior frontal gyrus of the dominant hemisphere (usually left). It is the anterior area responsible for the motor component of language production. Pathology in this region may result in expressive dysphasia.

### Wernicke's area

- Traditionally associated with receptive dysphasia, this area is considered to consist of the posterior section of the superior temporal gyrus in the dominant cerebral hemisphere (which is the left hemisphere in about 90% of people).

- CLINICAL TIP  
    > Occipital lobe lesions  
    > Occipital lobe lesions cause:  
        - partial seizures—visual hallucinations of unformed nature, e.g. lights and colours (simple partial seizures)  
        - sensory/motor deficit—contralateral homonymous hemianopia.  
    > Bilateral occipital lobe lesions cause cortical blindness of which the patient may be unaware (Anton's syndrome).  
    > Bilateral occipito-parietal lesions can spare elementary vision but prevent the recognition and depiction of objects (apperceptive visual agnosia).

- fibres from the vestibular nuclei in the medulla involved in vestibule-ocular reflexes.
- Thus this system is able to create conjugate eye movements with abduction in one eye and simultaneous adduction in the fellow eye.

- HELPFUL HINT  
    > Each cranial nerve has a motor or sensory (or both) nucleus in the brain, and peripheral nerves emerge from the brain and exit from the skull to reach their targets.  
    > Cranial nerves I, II, and VIII are entirely sensory.  
    > Cranial nerves III, IV, VI, XI, and XII are entirely motor.  
    > Cranial nerves V, VII, IX, and X have both sensory and motor components.

- There is no vertical equivalent of the PPRF, although the construction of vertical saccades is thought to be localized to the rostral interstitial nucleus of the MLF. This structure also receives instructions and information from the frontal eye fields, the vestibular nuclei, and the PPRF.
- Instructions to create upward saccadic movement travel through the posterior commissure to the division of the third nerve, which controls the muscles of upgaze. In downward gaze the instructions travel to the third and fourth (superior oblique) nuclei.

## Cranial nerves that pass through the orbit

### The oculomotor nerve (III)

    - The third cranial nerve supplies every extraocular muscle except the superior oblique and the lateral rectus. It also supplies the sphincter pupillae and the ciliary muscle with parasympathetic fibres.
    - The third nerve nuclei are situated in the midbrain at the level of the superior colliculus (Fig. 1.11). They contain two motor nuclei:
    - the main motor nucleus is situated in the anterior grey matter surrounding the cerebral aqueduct of the midbrain
    - the accessory parasympathetic nucleus (Edinger–Westphal nucleus) lies posterior to the main motor nucleus. Preganglionic nerves travel to the orbit to synapse in the ciliary ganglion. Postganglionic fibres travel along short ciliary nerves to the ciliary muscles and sphincter pupillae of the iris. The accessory nucleus also receives:  
    - corticonuclear fibres for accommodation  
    - fibres from the pretectal nucleus for the direct and consensual light reflex.

    - The third nerve emerges anteriorly from the midbrain, medial to the cerebral peduncle, and enters the subarachnoid space. It continues anteriorly between the posterior cerebral artery and the superior cerebellar arteries. The nerve then runs parallel with the posterior communicating artery (Fig. 1.12).
    - The nerve perforates dura mata on the lateral side of the posterior clinoid process and enters the cavernous sinus wall running above the trochlear nerve (IV). - The nerve then passes forward, receiving two branches:
    - the sensory communicating branch from the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve.
    - the sympathetic branch from the nerve plexus around the internal carotid artery.

    - CLINICAL TIP  
    > Internuclear ophthalmoplegia  
    > Internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO) is a clinical manifestation of intrinsic brainstem disease. It is usually caused by demyelination or ischaemia. It has distinctive clinical features that indicate a lesion in the medial longitudinal fasciculus.  
    > INO is seen as a lag of the adducting eye, with nystagmus of the abducting eye occurring on completion of a conjugate eye movement. The impairment of adduction is due to interruption of fibres in the MLF on the ipsilateral side. The nystagmus of the contralateral abducting eye is a jerk type, with fast phase away from the midline. The mechanism of nystagmus is not fully understood. Convergence may also be affected in INO.  
    > In some patients, adduction may be normal on versions and slowing of adducting saccades may be the only clinical finding (saccades require higher frequency discharge).  
    > In multiple sclerosis, the INO may be bilateral (BINO). In this case, both eyes may have limitation of adduction and nystagmus on abduction.

    - The oculomotor nerve now divides into a small superior division and a large inferior division, which enter the orbit through the superior orbital fissure (SOF) within the tendinous ring.
    - The superior division of the oculomotor nerve passes upwards and lateral to the optic nerve and enters the superior rectus muscle at the junction of its proximal and middle thirds. The nerve passes through the superior rectus muscle and terminates in the levator palpebrae superioris muscle.
    - The inferior division of the oculomotor nerve divides into three branches, which supply the medial and inferior recti, and the inferior oblique muscles. The branch to the medial rectus passes medially below the optic nerve to enter the lateral surface of the muscle between the proximal and middle third. The branch to the inferior rectus runs forwards on its upper surface and enters the muscle between the proximal and middle third. The branch to the inferior oblique is the longest of the three, and passes forwards close to the orbital floor and lateral to the inferior rectus. It enters the posterior border of the oblique muscle. The nerve to the inferior oblique gives a short branch to the ciliary ganglion. This contains parasympathetic fibres that synapse in the ciliary ganglion. The postganglionic fibres travel in the short ciliary nerves to supply the sphincter pupillae and ciliary muscles.
    - Three points of interest surround the muscles that are innervated by the third nerve nuclei:

    1. The levator is supplied by a single central group of cells (central caudal nucleus) via both third nerve nuclei.
    2. The superior rectus remains the only muscle of those innervated by the third nerve to be supplied by the contralateral third nerve nucleus.
    3. The other muscles supplied by the third cranial nerve are supplied by the ipsilateral oculomotor nerve nucleus.

### The trochlear nerve (IV)

- As the thinnest of the cranial nerves, the fourth nerve supplies the contralateral superior oblique muscle.
- The fourth cranial nerve nuclei are located beneath the third nuclei at the level of the inferior colliculus (Fig. 1.13). The trochlear nucleus is situated in the anterior part of the grey matter surrounding the cerebral aqueduct of the midbrain. This nucleus is entirely motor and receives fibres as follows:

  - corticonuclear fibres from both cerebral hemispheres
  - tectobulbar fibres, which connect it to the visual cortex via the superior colliculus
  - fibres from the medial longitudinal fasciculus, which connect it to the nucleus of the third, sixth, and eighth cranial nerves.
  - the fibres of the fourth nerve decussate before exiting the midbrain and are the only cranial nerves to exit posteriorly (Fig. 1.13).
  - the nerve runs forward in the subarachnoid space around the surface of the midbrain around the cerebellar peduncles to eventually run anteriorly (Fig. 1.13).
  - the nerve then enters the cavernous sinus wall in a position inferior to the third nerve, and exits the sinus above the third nerve.
  - the nerve passes through the SOF, outside the common tendinous ring (CTR) and medial to the frontal nerve in order to access the orbit.

    > CLINICAL TIP  
    > The proximity of the third nerve to the posterior communicating arteries and the superior cerebellar arteries means that any aneurysm arising in these vessels can impinge on the nerve, producing a palsy affecting the actions of this nerve.

- The nerve then passes medially, superior to the root of the levator palpebrae, before supplying the superior oblique.

### The abducens (VI) nerve

#### Course

- The sole motor supply to the lateral rectus is the sixth cranial nerve.
- The nucleus of the sixth cranial nerve lies near the floor of the fourth ventricle. It exits the brainstem anteriorly between the pons and medulla and lies within the subarachnoid space (Fig. 1.14).
- The nerve runs anteriorly, superiorly, and laterally to reach the dorsum sellae of the sphenoid bone.
- From the dorsum sellae, the nerve travels anteriorly over the petrous apex of the temporal bone to enter the cavity of the cavernous sinus. Here it runs inferonasally to the internal carotid artery.
- In the cavernous sinus, a sympathetic branch travels with the nerve from the internal carotid plexus, which later leaves the abducens nerve to join the oculomotor nerve.
- The sixth nerve enters the orbit through the SOF, within the CTR, between the superior and inferior division of the third nerve.
- The sixth nerve finally innervates the lateral rectus by moving anteriorly and laterally within the orbit.

### The trigeminal nerve (V)

####

- The trigeminal nucleus is divided into four nuclei:

  - main sensory nucleus—lies in the posterior pons
  - spinal nucleus—continuous superiorly with the main sensory nucleus in the pons and extends inferiorly through the whole length of the medulla oblongata and down to the second cervical vertebra (C2) of the spinal cord
  - mesencephalic nucleus—a collection of nerve cells in the lateral grey matter around the cerebral aqueduct
  - motor nucleus—medial to the main sensory nucleus.

- Sensations of pain, temperature, touch, and pressure are communicated along axons with cell bodies in the trigeminal ganglion. This lies on the apex of the petrous part of the temporal bone. The preganglionic cells enter the pons as ascending or descending branches. The ascending branches terminate in the main sensory nucleus (touch and pressure) and the descending cells terminate in the spinal nucleus (pain and temperature). The motor component of the trigeminal nerve travels in V3.

#### The ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve (V1)

#####

- V1 arises from the anteromedial surface of the trigeminal ganglion and moves anteriorly in order to enter the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus beneath the fourth nerve but above the maxillary nerve (V2).
- Before accessing the orbit via the SOF V1 divides into the following branches:

  - the frontal nerve
  - the lacrimal nerve
  - the nasocilliary nerve.

##### The lacrimal nerve

- Both the lacrimal and frontal nerves enter the orbit through the lateral part of the SOF, external to the CTR. Once within the orbit, the lacrimal nerve accepts parasympathetic

  > CLINICAL TIP  
  > Only the sixth nerve runs within the cavernous sinus and it becomes one of the first cranial nerves to be affected in cavernous sinus thrombosis.  
  > The sixth and seventh cranial nerves are closely linked not only because the facial nerve (VII) wraps around the sixth nerve nuclei to give rise to the facial colliculus, but also because of the closeness in the area of the petrous part of the temporal bone. In middle ear infections, the petrous part of the temporal bone may be breached, forming a combined sixth and seventh nerve palsy (Gradenigo's syndrome). The three cranial nerves that supply eye movement are closely related, as shown in Fig. 1.15.

##### The frontal nerve

- As the thickest branch of V1, the nerve enters the orbit between the lacrimal and the fourth nerve within the SOF, external to the CTR. The frontal nerve travels in the superior aspect of the orbit and divides into a large supraorbital branch and a supratrochlear branch.
- The supraorbital branch supplies the upper lid, conjunctiva, and the skin of the forehead as far back as the vertex. As the nerve passes through the supraorbital notch, it supplies a small branch to the mucous membrane of the frontal sinus. The supratrochlear nerve travels above the trochlea of the superior oblique and moves upwards to pierce the orbital septum to eventually innervate the medial upper lid and the medial skin of the forehead.

##### The nasociliary nerve

- The nasociliary nerve enters the orbit through the SOF within the CTR and lies between the superior and inferior branches of the third nerve on the lateral aspect of the optic nerve.
- The nasociliary nerve then wraps anteriorly around the optic nerve in a superomedial fashion across the optic nerve's upper surface to supply the medial wall with its posterior ethmoidal nerves. After giving off the posterior ethmoidal nerve (often missing, supplies ethmoidal and sphenoidal air sinuses) it passes into the anterior ethmoidal foramen, where it is then named the anterior ethmoidal nerve, which supplies the mucous membranes of the ethmoidal air cells and enters the cranial cavity. It later also supplies the skin on the dorsum of the nose, including the tip and vestibule. Thus, if the skin of the nose is affected by shingles (Hutchinson's sign), it is likely that there will be ocular involvement.
- Other branches of the nasociliary nerve include:

  - the ramus communicans (to the ciliary ganglion)—this arises from the nasociliary nerve as soon as it enters the orbit and contains sensory fibres (which travel along the ciliary nerves) from the eyeball
  - the long ciliary nerves (usually two) pass forward from the ciliary ganglion to pierce the eyeball near the optic nerve—these pass forward in the choroid to supply the ciliary body, iris, and cornea, and are composed of:  

    - sympathetic postganglionic fibres to the dilator pupillae  
    - sensory fibres from the cornea  
    - the infratrochlear nerve—this emerges from the nasociliary nerve and moves anteriorly underneath the trochlea and penetrates both orbital septum and orbicularis oculi to innervate the lacrimal sac, conjunctiva, the medial aspect of both eyelids, and the lateral skin of the nose.

#### The maxillary branch of the trigeminal (V2)

- V2 is the second entirely sensory division of the trigeminal nerve. As V2 leaves the trigeminal ganglion, it enters the wall of the cavernous sinus beneath V1 as the most inferior nerve within the wall. The nerve leaves the skull through the foramen rotundum, which transmits V2 to the pterygopalatine fossa, where it joins the pterygopalatine ganglion. The nerve passes anterolaterally through the IOF and continues as the infraorbital nerve. This runs in the infraorbital canal situated on the floor of the orbit. Whilst in this canal, the nerve is separated from the orbital contents by the overlying orbitalis muscle. It is only separated from the maxillary sinus below (as are the rest of the orbital contents) by a thin sheet of bone.
- The branches of V2 are as follows:

  - meningeal—this supplies dura mater in the MCF
  - ganglionic—the two ganglionic branches suspend the pterygopalatine ganglion from the lower border of the maxillary nerve. These contain sensory nerves from the orbital periosteum and mucous membranes of the nose, palate, and pharynx. They also contain postganglionic parasympathetic fibres that travel from the facial nerve to the lacrimal gland
  - zygomatic—this arises from V2 in the pterygopalatine fossa, running into the orbit through the SOF. It divides into the zygomaticotemporal and zygomaticofacial branches, which supply the skin of the forehead and cheek, respectively (Fig. 1.18).
  - posterior superior alveolar—this again arises from V2 in the pterygopalatine fossa and supplies the mucous membranes of the maxillary sinus. It also joins the dental plexus to supply upper molar teeth, gums, and part of the mucous membrane of the cheek (Fig. 1.18)
  - middle superior alveolar—this arises from the infraorbital nerve and runs down the lateral wall of the maxillary sinus to join the superior dental plexus and supply the upper molar teeth, gums, and part of the mucous membranes of the cheek (Fig. 1.18)
  - anterior superior alveolar—this arises from the infraorbital nerve in the infraorbital canal and runs on the anterior wall of the maxillary sinus to supply the canine and incisor teeth (Fig. 1.18)
  - facial nerves—these emerge via the infraorbital foramen to supply sensation for the skin of the cheek and mucous membrane of the upper lip.

## The visual pathway

###

1. neural retina
2. optic nerve
3. chiasm
4. optic tract
5. lateral geniculate nucleus
6. optic radiations
7. visual cortex.

### Optic nerve

- intraocular (1 mm)
- intraorbital (25 mm)
  - The blood supply to this region is from the pial plexus of vessels, which receives its arterial supply from neighbouring branches of the ophthalmic artery and a few branches of the central retinal artery.
    - The optic canal lies entirely within the lesser wing of the sphenoid bone. It measures 5 mm in length and transmits two structures:
      - the ophthalmic artery.
      - optic nerve
- intracanalicular (5 mm)
- intracranial (10 mm).
  - The blood supply to this portion is from the pial plexus with branches from the ophthalmic artery. The intracranial portion of the nerve moves superiorly, posteriorly, and medially to arrive at the optic chiasm, in the floor of the third ventricle. This region also receives its blood supply from the pial plexus, which is supplied by branches of the superior hypophyseal artery, the internal carotid artery, and the ophthalmic artery.

- The intraocular portion describes the optic nerve as it pierces the sclera. When viewed from within the optic nerve is seen en face as the optic disc.
- Blood supply to this region of the optic nerve is supplied by branches of the anastomotic circle of Zinn in the sclera around the optic nerve. This in turn receives its blood supply from the short posterior ciliary arteries. The central retinal artery does not supply this part of the optic nerve.
- The intraorbital portion is approximately 25 mm in length. This is around 6 mm longer than the eyeball and optic canal. In this portion, around 12 mm from the eyeball, the central retinal artery inserts into the nerve and the central retinal vein exits the dura.
- The centre of the nerve contains a majority of ganglion cell neurons and a minority of other neural glial cells such as astrocytes. As the nerve leaves the globe, it immediately begins to thicken (from 1.5 to 3–4 mm). This is due to myelination of the axons, which begins behind the posterior lamina cribrosa.
- The optic nerve sheath comprises three components, which are posteriorly continuous with the meninges of the brain:

  1. dura
  2. arachnoid
  3. pia mater.

### Optic chiasm

- At the optic chiasm, nasal retinal fibres decussate to the contralateral optic tract. The temporal retinal fibres remain in the ipsilateral optic tract. Crossed fibres may loop into either the ipsilateral optic tract or the contralateral optic nerve for a short distance after they pass through the chiasm.
- Nerve fibres from the inferior nasal retina cross at the anterior part of the chiasm, whereas nerve fibres from the superior nasal retina cross at the posterior part of the retina.
- The chiasm usually lies above the diaphragm sellae, the seat of which holds the pituitary (Fig. 1.20). Anterior to the chiasm lie the anterior cerebral arteries and the anterior communicating artery. Posterior lies the tuber cinereum, and laterally the internal carotid arteries. Superiorly lies the third ventricle. The optic chiasm has dimensions of 12 by 8 mm and has a covering of pia mater. It projects down into the subarachnoid space. Anterolaterally it is continuous with the optic nerves and posterolaterally with the optic tracts.
- Blood supply to the nervous tissue comes from the pial vessels, which are supplied by branches of the internal carotid artery, the superior hypophyseal branch of the internal carotid artery, the anterior cerebral artery, and the anterior communicating artery.

### Optic tracts

- Two optic tracts emerge from the posterolateral aspect of the optic chiasm. Each tract passes posterolaterally, lateral to the tuber cinereum medially. The tract flattens and winds around the lateral margin of the upper part of the cerebral peduncle. Most of the nerve fibres terminate in the lateral geniculate body. These fibres are concerned with visual sensation.
- Before they reach the lateral geniculate, 10% of nerve fibres pass (medially to the superior colliculus) to the pretectal nucleus. These fibres are involved in the light reflex.
- Blood supply to the optic tracts is by the pial vessels, which are fed by the anterior choroidal artery, the posterior communicating artery, and the middle cerebral artery.

### Lateral geniculate nucleus

- Located under the pulvinar of the thalamus, the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus is a laminated structure that is composed of six layers of cells separated from each other by white bands of optic nerve fibres (1 to 6). These nerve fibres are the myelinated axons of ganglion cells from the retina. They represent cells from the temporal half of the ipsilateral retina (layers 2, 3, and 5) and nasal half of the contralateral retina (layers 1, 4, and 6). Thus, each lateral geniculate body receives visual input from both retinas.
- Blood supply to the lateral geniculate body comes from the anterior choroidal branch of the middle cerebral artery, the thalamogeniculate branches of the posterior cerebral artery, and the lateral choroidal arteries.

### Optic radiations (geniculocalcarine tracts)

- These are formed from the nerve fibres that originate in the lamellae of the lateral geniculate body.
- Fibres from the lateral part of this lateral geniculate body receive inputs from inferior retinal quadrants (corresponds to superior visual field), and these travel laterally and inferiorly around the anterior inferior aspect of the horn of the fourth ventricle. Fibres from the periphery loop furthest away (loop of Meyer) and fibres from the macula, by contrast, loop very little. These fibres from the optic radiations continue posteriorly, joining the internal capsule and then travelling laterally to the horns of the lateral ventricle. They then turn medially to the occipital cortex.
- Fibres from the medial portion of the lateral geniculate body receive inputs from the superior retinal quadrants (inferior visual field) and turn directly posteriorly to travel in the retrolentiform part of the internal capsule.
- Blood supply to the anterior part of the optic radiations comes from the anterior choroidal branch of the internal carotid artery. The posterior portion is supplied by the middle and posterior cerebral arteries.

### The primary visual cortex

- The location of the primary visual cortex is within the walls of the calcarine sulcus and corresponds to Brodmann's area 17. The calcarine sulcus is situated on the medial aspect of the cerebral hemispheres.
- The primary visual cortex begins proximally at the junction of the calcarine and parieto-occipital sulci and continues all the way to the posterior pole of the occipital cortex. Each hemisphere receives information from its ipsilateral lateral geniculate nucleus. Hence, the right half of the visual field is represented in the left cerebral cortex.
- The visual cortex located above the calcarine sulcus receives fibres related to the superior retina (ipsilateral superior temporal fibres and contralateral superior nasal fibres) and thus the inferior visual field. The cortex located below the calcarine sulcus, however, receives inputs from the inferior retina (superior field of vision).
- The representation of the macula in the visual cortex is relatively large and is situated on the posterior pole of the calcarine sulcus and extends posterolaterally to the occipital cortex. This accounts for one-third of the visual cortex.
- The secondary visual cortex (areas 18 and 19) surround area 17. They receive afferent fibres from the primary visual area, other cortical areas, and the thalamus
- This area relates visual information from the primary area to previous visual experience. Area 18 plays a role in integrating the two halves of the visual field via commissural fibres that cross the midline. It may be of importance in sensory-motor coordination and control of the cranial nerve nuclei in their role in eye movement.
- The visual cortex receives its blood supply from the posterior (and middle) cerebral artery.

# Orbit and adnexa

## The orbit

- The orbits are a pair of large bony sockets that house the eyeballs and include the muscles, nerves, vessels, and fat as well as most of the ocular appendages. Each cavity is of pyramidal shape with its apex directed posteriorly, medially, and superiorly.

- The orbit is composed of seven bones:
    1. frontal
    2. zygomatic
    3. maxillary
    4. ethmoidal
    5. sphenoid
    6. lacrimal
    7. palatine.

- Anteriorly, the orbital rim (or margin) is quadrilateral in shape. The supraorbital margin is composed of the frontal bone. The supraorbital notch (or foramen) is located at the junction of the sharp lateral two-thirds and the rounded medial third. The sharp infraorbital margin is formed laterally by the zygomatic bone and medially by the maxilla. The lateral margin is formed by the frontal process of the zygomatic bone inferiorly and superiorly by the zygomatic process of the frontal bone.
- The medial margin is formed by the maxillary process of the frontal bone above and by the lacrimal crest of the frontal process of the maxilla.

- The orbit is divided into four walls (Fig. 1.22), each of which is lined with periosteum:
  - roof
  - floor
  - medial wall
  - lateral wall.

## The orbital roof

The orbital roof comprises two bones:

- the orbital plate of the frontal bone
- the lesser wing of sphenoid bone (posteriorly).

- Two key features reside within the roof:  
  - the lacrimal fossa for the lacrimal gland—this is located anterolaterally behind the zygomatic process of the frontal bone
  - the trochlea, which is the pulley for the tendon of the superior oblique muscle, lies medial to the supraorbital notch and 4 mm behind the orbital margin.

## The orbital floor

The orbital roof comprises three bones:

- orbital plate of maxillary bone
- small orbital process of palatine bone
- orbital surface of zygomatic bone.

- The thin floor of the orbit is mainly formed by the orbital plate of the maxilla, which separates the orbit from the maxillary sinus. The floor is continuous with the lateral wall except posteriorly, where the floor is separated by the IOF from the lateral wall
- Running forward from the fissure is the infraorbital groove, which runs in an anterior direction. As this groove nears the orbital margin, it descends inferiorly into a canal that exits the skull as the infraorbital foramen just 4 mm below the inferior orbital margin on the maxillary bone. The infraorbital canal/foramen transmits

## The medial orbital wall

The medial orbital wall comprises four bones (anterior to posterior):

- the frontal process of the maxilla
- lacrimal
- ethmoid
- lesser wing of sphenoid.

- The medial wall runs anteroposteriorly and parallel to the saggital plane. Anteriorly, it contains the lacrimal groove, which is the bony housing for the lacrimal sac. The groove itself is formed from lacrimal bone and the frontal process of maxilla.
- The nasolacrimal canal extends inferiorly from the lacrimal fossa on the medial wall and terminates in the inferior nasal meatus in the nasal cavity.
- The medial wall is the thinnest of the orbital walls and its paper-like appearance is reflected in its name: lamina papyracea.

## The lateral orbital wall

- This is the thickest wall and comprises two bones:

  - zygomatic
  - greater wing of sphenoid.

- The lateral wall diverges at an angle of 45° from the saggital plane
- Anteriorly, the zygoma separates this bone from the temporal fossa
- Posteriorly, the greater wing of the sphenoid separates the orbit from the temporal lobe of the brain in the MCF. The lateral wall and roof are continuous anteriorly but are separated posteriorly by the SOF.
- Whitnall's (lateral orbital) tubercle lies posterior to the orbital margin, on the frontal process of the zygoma. Four structures are attached to this eminence:

    1. the lateral palpebral ligament
    2. the suspensory ligament of the eyeball
    3. the check ligament of the lateral rectus muscle
    4. the aponeurosis of levator.

## Openings of the orbit

###

- The main opening of the orbit is anteriorly. Posteriorly, the optic canal lies in the lesser wing of the sphenoid and is 4–10 mm long. It is related medially to the body of the sphenoid. It connects the MCF with the orbital cavity. The optic canal transmits the optic nerve along with its meninges, an extension of the subarachnoid space, and the ophthalmic artery along with its surrounding sympathetic plexus.  

- The SOF lies between the greater and lesser wings of the sphenoid. It connects the MCF with the orbital cavity. It lies between the roof and lateral wall of the orbit. At the infero- medial end of the SOF lies a CTR, which is the origin for the four rectus muscles.  

- The following structures pass through the SOF outside the CTR (**Fig. 1.23**):  

  - lacrimal nerve  
  - frontal nerve  
  - trochlear nerve (CN IV)  
  - superior ophthalmic vein  
  - inferior ophthalmic vein  

- The following structures pass through the SOF inside the CTR (**Fig. 1.23**):  

  - upper division of oculomotor nerve (CN III)  
  - lower division of oculomotor nerve (CN III)  
  - nasociliary nerve  
  - abducens nerve (CN VI)  

- The IOF lies between the greater wing of the sphenoid and the maxilla. It connects both the pterygopalatine and infero- temporal fossae with the orbital cavity. In living subjects, this is closed by the periorbita and the muscle of Müller. It transmits the maxillary nerve, which on passing through the IOF is renamed the infraorbital nerve. It also transmits the zygomat- ic nerve, branches of the pterygopalatine ganglion, and the inferior ophthalmic vein, which drains to the pterygoid plexus.  

- Two ethmoidal foramen lie in the frontal bone and the frontoethmoidal suture. They are situated where the roof joins the medial wall. The anterior ethmoidal foramen joins from the orbit to the ACF. The posterior ethmoidal fora- men traverses the ethmoid bone and joins the orbit to the ethmoidal sinuses. The anterior and posterior ethmoidal nerves and arteries pass through these.  

- The zygomaticofacial foramen lies on the lateral wall and floor, and transmits the zygomaticofacial nerve. The zygomaticotemporal foramen lies above this, close to the sphenozygomatic suture and it transmits the zygomatico- temporal nerve.  

## The orbital vasculature**  

### The ophthalmic artery  

- On exit from the cavernous sinus, the internal carotid artery releases its first branch, which is the ophthalmic artery (**Fig. 1.24**).  

- Within the orbit and after producing the central retinal artery, the ophthalmic artery swings medially above the optic nerve. In 15% of people, the ophthalmic artery passes below the optic nerve. The nasociliary artery follows suit.  

- The central retinal artery lies beneath the optic nerve and pierces the dura 12 mm behind the globe from an inferome- dial direction.  

- The ophthalmic artery then produces the following tribu- taries:  

  - the lacrimal artery  
  - the long and short posterior ciliary arteries  
  - the muscular arteries (extraocular muscle branches)  
  - the supraorbital artery  
  - the posterior and anterior ethmoidal artery  
  - the medial palpebral arteries  

- Finally, the ophthalmic artery terminates as the supra- trochlear arteries and the dorsal nasal arteries.  

### The central retinal artery  
- After penetrating the optic nerve, the central retinal artery continues anteriorly within the subarachnoid space and pro- vides small meningeal arteries to the pial layer. Here the central retinal artery is followed by the central retinal vein.  

- Passing through the lamina cribrosa, the central retinal artery performs its task as an end artery to the retina.  

- Despite small communications with the pial plexus and the circle of Zinn, the central retinal artery is usually consid- ered separate to the ciliary arteries.  

### The cilioretinal artery  

- Cilioretinal arteries are present within 20% of the popula- tion and supply the retina between the macula and the optic nerve from a posterior ciliary artery source. This supply includes the nerve fibres from the foveal photoreceptors. If this artery is present, the macula often remains perfused even in the case of a central retinal artery occlusion.  

### The ciliary arteries  

####

- The long and short posterior ciliary arteries as well as the anterior arteries represent the vast majority of the blood supply to the globe.  

#### The long posterior ciliary arteries  

- These twinned arteries arise from the ophthalmic artery as it crosses the optic nerve. They run forward with the optic nerve and penetrate the sclera outside the circle of Zinn (formed by the short posterior ciliary arteries). They then traverse the suprachoroidal (between the sclera and choroid) space to reach the ciliary body. - Here, the posterior ciliary arteries join the supply from the anterior ciliary arteries (formed by the muscular branches of the ophthalmic artery) to supply the major arterial circle. The combination of the two supplies provides arterial blood to the choroid posteri- orly as far as the equator of the globe. They also anastomose with the short posterior arteries to complete the choroidal circulation.  

#### The short posterior ciliary arteries  

- The short posterior ciliary arteries penetrate the globe around the optic nerve head to form the arterial circle of Zinn. This provides the optic nerve head with arterial blood. The short posterior ciliary arteries also travel anteriorly within the suprachoroidal space to supply the choroid up to the equator of the globe.  

#### The anterior ciliary arteries 

- The venous drainage of the eye: The superior ophthalmic vein arises in the medial aspect of the upper lid from a combination of the supraorbital vein and a branch from the facial vein. The superior ophthalmic vein is often larger than its inferior counterpart and passes backward in the orbital fat, collecting venous tributaries that come from most areas supplied by the ophthalmic arteries, including the superior vortex veins and the central retinal vein.  

- The inferior orbital veins begin by draining a venous plex- us situated at the anterior part of the orbit floor. It interacts with venous supplies such as the facial vein and the ptery- goid venous plexus via the inferior orbital margin and the IOF, respectively.  

- As it passes backwards beneath the globe on the inferior rectus, the inferior ophthalmic vein drains the two inferior vortex veins.  

- Approaching the orbital apex, the inferior ophthalmic vein combines with the superior ophthalmic vein before exiting the orbit via the supraorbital fissure into the cavern- ous sinus. Occasionally, the two ophthalmic veins drain separately into the cavernous sinus.  

- Given that the pterygoid plexus is in such close proximity to the cavernous sinus, it is possible to spread infection from one to the other. This may result in a cavernous sinus thrombosis and represents an ophthalmological emergency.

### The cavernous sinus 
####

- The median part of the MCF is formed by the body of the sphenoid bone. The cavernous sinus fills the majority of the inside of the body of the sphenoid bone, and is directly related to the side of this bone (see also **Fig. 1.20**). This large venous sinus receives venous drainage from the supe- rior and inferior ophthalmic veins. They also receive venous blood from:  
- the sphenoparietal sinus (from above)  
- the inferior and superficial middle cerebral vein  

#### Drainage of the cavernous sinus  

- Although there are multiple routes of venous drainage from the cavernous sinus, the main drainage sites are as follows:  
- The superior and inferior petrosal sinuses drain blood from the cavernous sinus into the internal jugular vein.  
- An emissary vein that is transmitted though the foramen ovale drains blood from the cavernous sinus to the ptery- goid plexus.  

#### Relations of the cavernous sinus  

- Superiorly: the pituitary gland.  
- Inferiorly: the sphenoid and its osteal covering.  
- Posteriorly: the apex of the petrous part of the temporal bone.  
- Anteriorly: SOF and orbit. Medially: the pituitary fossa.  

- The internal carotid artery enters the cranial cavity through the foramen lacerum and penetrates the posterior cavernous sinus before travelling forward near the medial walls of the sinus. Within the sinus but outside the endothelial lining, the sixth nerve and the internal carotid artery travel alongside each other. The separation of endothelial linings means that the two blood sources do not cross over.  

- As the internal carotid artery exits the cavernous sinus superiorly, it reflects backwards on itself before moving towards the anterior perforate substance of the brain.  

- From superior to inferior, the walls of the cavernous sinuses contain the following:  

1. third nerve  
2. fourth nerve  
3. sixth nerve  
4. ophthalmic division of the fifth nerve (V1)  
5. maxillary division of the fifth nerve (V2)  

## The extraocular muscles 
### Positions of the eye  
- Primary position pertains to when the eyeball is facing straight ahead.  

- The secondary positions pertain to when the eyeball is directed in horizontal and vertical deviations from the pri- mary position (up, down, left, right).  

- The tertiary position of the gaze concerns oblique move- ments from the primary position (up and left, down, right). These must not be confused with primary, secondary, and tertiary gaze or muscle actions.  

### The four rectus muscles  
####
- The four rectus muscles have their origin in the CTR at the apex of the orbit. The CTR is also known as the annulus of Zinn and is connected to the dural sheath of the optic nerve.  

- All four of the rectus muscles project forward within a sheath derived from Tenon’s capsule and attach to the globe. The superior and inferior recti run in a direction 25° to the optical axis.  

- On reaching the globe, each extraocular muscle inserts at different points behind the corneal limbus (**Fig. 1.25**). Starting with the medial rectus and moving around to finish at the superior rectus, they form a spiral, called the spiral of Tillaux. In order of their positions in the spiral of Tillaux, the four recti are the medial rectus, the inferior rectus, the lateral rectus, and the superior rectus.  

#### The medial rectus  
##### Innervation  
- Inferior division of the third cranial nerve. It inserts laterally at the proximal second quarter of the muscle.  

##### Course  
- From the medial CTR, the medial rectus is the largest of the four recti. It passes forward in the medial aspect of the orbit before entering the inferior Tenon’s capsule to insert behind the limbus as above.  

##### Relations  
- Above—superior oblique muscle, the ophthalmic artery and branches therein, the nasociliary nerve.  
Below—floor of the orbit.  

#### The inferior rectus  
##### Innervation  
- The inferior division of the third cranial nerve. It inserts superiorly at the proximal second quarter of the muscle.  

##### Course  
- From the inferior CTR, it passes forward and slightly lat- erally (because of the lateral direction of the orbit from its apex) before entering the inferior Tenon’s capsule to insert behind the limbus as above.  
- The inferior rectus acts 23° lateral to the optical axis.  
- The fascial sheath of the inferior rectus and that of the inferior oblique are connected to the suspensory ligament of the eyeball (Lockwood’s ligament). Lockwood’s liga- ment extends from the medial to lateral check ligaments and attaches the inferior rectus sheath to the lower lid.  

##### Relations  
- Above—the third nerve, the optic nerve, the eye. Below—floor of the orbit, the infraorbital nerve and vessels, maxillary sinus.  

#### The lateral rectus  
##### Innervation  
- The abducens (VI) nerve (hence abduction), which enters the muscle from the medial surface in the middle of the muscle.  

##### Course  
- The lateral rectus arises from two locations:  
  1. the main origin is the lateral CTR  
  2. a subsidiary arm is located outside and lateral to the CTR on the greater wing of sphenoid.  
- The muscle moves forward in the lateral portion of the orbit before entering the Tenon’s capsule to insert behind the limbus as above.  

##### Relations  
- Above—lacrimal nerve and artery. Below—floor of the orbit.  
- Medially—the abducens nerve.  

#### The superior rectus  
##### Innervation  
- Superior division of the third nerve. The nerve inserts infe- riorly at the proximal second quarter of the muscle and goes on to innervate the levator palpebrae.  

##### Course  
- From the CTR, the superior rectus passes forward, entering Tenon’s capsule before inserting behind the limbus.  
- The superior rectus acts 23° lateral to the optical axis.  
- The fascial sheath of the superior rectus and that of the levator palpebrae are connected such that they work in unison. This allows some degree of passive lid retraction on upward gaze.  

##### Relations  
- Above—levator palpebrae muscle, frontal nerve, orbit roof. Below—optic nerve, ophthalmic artery, nasociliary nerve, the superior oblique muscle.  

### The two oblique muscles  
- The oblique muscles aid the eye in rotatory movement known as in- or ex-cyclotorsion (in primary gaze).  

#### The superior oblique  
##### Innervation  
- The trochlear (IV) nerve.  

##### Course  
- The superior oblique originates external to the CTR, from the body of the sphenoid bone. Its origin is supero- nasal to the CTR and the optic nerve.  
- The body of the muscle then passes forward and medi- ally to bend around a connective-tissue pulley known as the trochlea (hence the innervation).  
- After diversion, via the trochlea, the muscle moves later- ally, downward, and slightly posteriorly, entering Tenon’s capsule before passing underneath the superior rectus and attaching to the globe.  
- The point of attachment is posterior to the equator and, when viewed from above, lies in the proximal lateral quadrant.  
- The superior oblique achieves intorsion by acting in a direction 54° to the optical axis.  

##### Relations  
- Above—superior rectus, roof of the orbit. Below—ophthalmic artery, the nasociliary nerve. Laterally—the supratrochlear nerve lies above and lateral to the superior oblique.  

#### The inferior oblique  
##### Innervation  
- The inferior division of the third nerve. This inserts into the middle of the muscle from above.  

##### Course  
- Of the six extraocular muscles, the inferior oblique is the only muscle to originate from the front of the orbit. It arises from the floor of orbit (near the junction of the maxillary plate and the lacrimal bone) lateral to the naso- lacrimal canal and just within the orbital rim.  
- It then moves laterally, backwards, and superiorly as it moves below the inferior rectus to curve upwards around the globe.  
- The attachment of the inferior oblique lies posterior to the equator, in the same quadrant (when viewed from above) as the superior oblique. Overlying the attachment is the lateral rectus.  
- The inferior oblique achieves excyclotorsion by acting in a direction 53° to the optical axis.  

##### Relations  
- Above—inferior rectus muscle and the eye. Below—the floor of the orbit.

### Muscle, action, and movement 
#### 
- Primary, secondary, and tertiary muscle actions are defined by their order of amplitude, primary being the largest ampli- tude of movement.  

- Assuming the starting point of the eyeball is the primary position, the primary, secondary, and tertiary muscle actions are shown in **Table 1.4**.  

- Apart from the medial and lateral recti, different gazes will change the alignment of each muscle and thus alter the mechanics and primary action accordingly (**Table 1.5**).  

- It is important to note that muscles do not work in isola- tion but depend on the position of the globe. Note that:  
- the superior and inferior recti pull back at 23° to the nasal side of the vertical axis with the eye in the primary position  
- the tendon of the superior oblique has a forward pull at an angle of 54° to the nasal side of the vertical axis of the eyeball with the eye in the primary position  
- the inferior oblique pulls forward at an angle of 51° to the nasal side of the vertical axis of the eyeball with the eye in the primary position  

- Once the eyeball moves, the position of the insertions relative to the origin changes and thus the muscle action changes. Hence, the careful coordination of all six muscles together is important and they all pull as a group of mus- cles. There must be conjugate movement of both eyes and hence 12 muscles must be coordinated through con- stant visual feedback to allow fine adjustments and pre- vent diplopia. Two principles contribute to regulation of eye movement:  
  - Hering’s law of equal innervation states that during any conjugate eye movement, equal and simultaneous inner- vation flows to the yoke muscle (contralateral synergist).  
  - Sherrington’s law of reciprocal innervation (inhibition) states that increased innervation to an extraocular mus- cle (e.g. right medial rectus) is accompanied by reciprocal decrease in innervation to its antagonist (i.e. right lateral rectus). This applies to both versions and vergences.  

#### Table 1.4 Primary, secondary, and tertiary action of extraocular muscles  

| Muscle            | Primary action                       | Secondary action            | Tertiary action           |  
|-------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|  
| Medial rectus     | Adduction–rotation around the y-axis | None                        | None                      |  
| Lateral rectus    | Abduction–rotation around the y-axis | None                        | None                      |  
| Superior rectus   | Elevation around the x-axis          | Adduction around the y-axis | Intortion around the z-axis |  
| Inferior rectus   | Depression around the x-axis         | Adduction around the y-axis | Extortion around the z-axis |  
| Superior oblique  | Depression around the x-axis         | Abduction around the y-axis | Intorsion around the z-axis |  
| Inferior oblique  | Elevation around the x-axis          | Abduction around the y-axis | Extortion around the z-axis |  

#### All three axes are mutually perpendicular: the z-axis represents the anteroposterior axis and equates to the optical axis, the x-axis represents the lateral- medial axis, and the y-axis represents the superoinferior axis.

## The eyelids

###

- The eyelids protect the eyes from injury and excessive light, spread tears over the surface of the eyes, and help with the exit of tears through the tear ducts.  

- A horizontal furrow (the superior palpebral sulcus) divides the eyelid into an orbital part and a tarsal part. The sulcus is created because of the insertion of aponeurotic fibres from the levator palpebrae superioris.  

- There is a similar sulcus in the lower lid, the inferior palpe- bral sulcus. This is created by adhesions between the skin and the orbicularis oculi. With age, two other sulci are also formed, the naso-jugal sulcus and the lateral (or malar) sulcus. The eyelids meet at the medial and lateral canthal angles or canthi, and the opening between the two lids is called the palpebral fissure. In Orientals, the medial angle is over- lapped by a vertical skin fold, the epicanthus. The lateral angle is in direct contact with the surface of the eye, where- as the medial angle lies around 6 mm medial to the part of the lid that remains in contact with the globe.  

- Medially, the two eyelids are separated by the lacus lacri- malis, in the middle of which lies the caruncula lacrimalis. A semi-lunar fold, the plica semilunaris, lies medial to the caruncula (**Fig. 1.26**).  

- Each eyelid margin is around 2 mm thick and 30 mm long. About 5 mm from the medial angle there is a mound, the papilla lacrimalis, at the summit of which is the punctum lac- rimale (0.4–0.8 mm diameter). The punctum leads into the lacrimal canal, which is discussed further in the section on the lacrimal system (p. 39). The papilla lacrimalis projects into the lacus lacrimalis and this apparatus serves to drain tears from the surface of the eyes.  

- From superficial to deep, the eyelid layers are as follows:  
  - skin  
  - subcutaneous tissue  
  - orbicularis oculi—striated muscle fibres  
  - orbital septum/tarsal plate  
  - conjunctiva  

- The skin of the eyelids is extremely thin and folds easily. It becomes continuous with the conjunctiva at the site of the orifices of the meibomian glands. Eyelashes are present in double or triple rows on the lid margin from the lateral angle to the papilla lacrimalis. These are more numerous on the upper lid (150) than the lower lid (75), are commonly darker than scalp hair, and do not lose pigmentation with age. They do not possess erector pili muscles and the seba- ceous glands of Zeiss and the ciliary glands of Moll open into the follicles of the lash or directly onto the lid margin.  

- The subcutaneous tissue is loose and mostly comprises elastic tissue and very little fat.  

- The orbicularis oculi muscle is a striated muscle that extends to the temporal region and cheek (orbital part) and onto the eyelids (palpebral part). The latter consists of thin bundles of fibres that arise from the medial palpebral ligament (MPL). These fibres are attached to the superficial and deep surface of the ligament but not to the inferior surface. They pass laterally and concentri- cally, and laterally they meet at the lateral palpebral raphe. The lacrimal part of the orbicularis oculi lies behind the lacrimal gland. Beneath the orbicularis oculi lies a layer of connective tissue that contains the blood vessels and nerves of the eyelids.  

- Medially, the attachments of orbicularis oculi are com- plex. The pretarsal muscles attach medially by a deep and superficial head. The superficial head forms the medial can- thal tendon. The deep head has fibres which begin at the medial end of the tarsal plates and insert to the posterior lacrimal crest, behind the lacrimal sac. The preseptal orbicu- laris oculi muscles also insert medially by a superficial and deep head. The superficial head joins with the medial can- thal tendon. The deep head inserts into the fascia overlying the lacrimal sac as well as into the medial orbital wall above and below the deep head of the pretarsal attachment of the orbicularis oculi.  

- Palpebral part of orbicularis	Preseptal Pretarsal	Orbital part of orbicularis muscle  
- Terminal branches of the zygomatic division of the facial nerve  

- The lateral palpebral ligament attaches the lateral ends of the tarsi to the marginal (Whitnall’s) tubercle on the orbital margin, as formed by the zygomatic bone. It lies under the lateral palpebral raphe.  

- The orbicularis oculi is supplied by temporal and zygo- matic branches of the facial nerve, which enter the deep surface of the nerve from laterally. - The orbital part muscle is mostly under voluntary control and pulls on the surround- ing tissues like a purse string to draw the lids towards the medial angle of the orbit. The palpebral part is under both voluntary and involuntary control. It draws up the lower lid and draws down the upper lid. - The blink reflex (involuntary) is initiated by drying of the cornea. The lacrimal portion draws the eyelids medially and contributes to the pumping mechanism of tear drainage as well as positioning the punc- ta lacrimalis.  

- The orbital septum is a membranous sheet (composed of seven layers) that is attached to the orbital margin, where it is continuous with the periosteum. It acts to separate the eyelids from the contents of the orbit.  

- The tarsal plates consist of fibrous tissue that acts as a skeleton for the eyelids. The tarsal plate of the upper lid is around 10 mm in height in the centre. Attached at its upper end is the orbital septum and the smooth muscle fibres of the levator palpebrae superioris. The tarsal plate of the lower lid measures around 5 mm in height centrally. The orbital septum is attached at its lower end. The tarsal plate is actually 70% composed of glandular structure because of the presence of meibomian glands within them. There are 20–25 meibomian glands arranged in a single row in each upper and lower lid. These are modified sebaceous glands, made of a long central canal surrounded by 10–15 acini. They secrete an oily sub- stance that prevents overflow of tears, reduces evapora- tion of tears, and allows the closure of the eyelids to be airtight.  

- The superior tarsal muscle (Müller’s muscle) is continu- ous superiorly with the levator palpebrae superioris and inferiorly with the tarsal plate of the upper lid. This muscle assists the striated muscle of the upper lid in elevating the upper lid. The inferior tarsal muscle is attached to the lower margin of the tarsal plate of the lower eyelid and is continu- ous with the fascial sheath of the inferior rectus muscle. Both muscles have a sympathetic nerve supply.  

- The conjunctiva is described on page 42. Importantly with relation to the adnexa, the fornices of the conjunctivae (the points at which it is reflected back on itself ) have attachments to the aponeurosis of the levator palpebrae superioris (superior fornix) and the aponeurosis of the infe- rior rectus muscle (inferior fornix).  

- The normal position of the upper lid is maintained by the levator palpebrae superioris. This is a striated muscle that is only present in the upper lid. It has an aponeurotic tendon that begins posterior to the orbital septum.  

- The orbital septum is attached to the anterior surface of the aponeurotic fibres as a thickened band about 8 mm below Whitnall’s ligament and 3–4 mm above the tarsus. This inserts medially into the trochlea and laterally into the capsule of the lacrimal gland and orbital wall. It acts as a fulcrum for the levator palpebrae.  

- The preaponeurotic fat pad, an important surgical land- mark, lies between the posterior surface of the septum and the levator aponeurosis.  

- The levator aponeurosis passes anteriorly and inferiorly and has four attachments:  
  1. anterior surface of the upper lid tarsal plate posteriorly  
  2. muscular fibres of orbicularis oculi anteriorly  
  3. upper lid skin to form the skin crease  
  4. superior conjunctival fornix  

- The nerve supply to the levator palpebrae superioris is by the superior branch of the oculomotor nerve.  

- The medial and lateral extents of the levator are in the form of two ‘horns’ into the region of the canthal tendons. The lacrimal gland is closely associated with the posterior edge of the lateral horn.  

- Müller’s muscle is a smooth muscle with sympathetic innervations that arises from the underside of the levator muscle. It is 15–20 mm wide and descends between the levator aponeurosis and conjunctiva for 15–20 mm to insert into the superior border of the tarsal plate.  

- Arterial supply of the eyelids comes from the lateral and medial palpebral arteries:  
  - The lateral palpebral artery branches from the lacrimal artery, itself a branch of the ophthalmic artery.  
  - The medial palpebral arteries (superior and inferior) arise from the ophthalmic artery below the trochlea of the superior oblique muscle, pass behind the lacrimal sac, and enter the eyelids.  
  - Each medial palpebral artery divides into two branches that pass laterally, forming two arches in each upper and lower lid. The arches anastomose with the lat- eral palpebral arteries as well as with branches of the superficial temporal, transverse facial, and infraorbital arteries.  

- The veins of the eyelids drain:  
  - medially into the ophthalmic and angular veins  
  - laterally into the superficial temporal vein  

- Lymphatic vessels from the lateral two-thirds of the upper and lower lids drain to the superficial parotid nodes. Those from the medial angle drain to the submandibular nodes.  

- Sensation to the upper lids is from the ophthalmic divi- sion of the trigeminal nerve. The following branches are involved: infratrochlear, supratrochlear, supraorbital, and lacrimal nerves.  

- Sensation to the lower lid is supplied by the infratrochlear branch of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal at the medial angle. The rest of the lower lid is supplied by branch- es of the infraorbital nerve, the terminal portion of the max- illary branch of the trigeminal nerve.

## The lacrimal system  

###
- Tears are produced by the lacrimal gland and the acces- sory lacrimal glands to form the tear lake. This lake drains via the superior (20%) and inferior (80%) punctae in the lids. These punctae are connected via canaliculi to the lacrimal sac, which then drains via the nasolacrimal ducts into the inferior nasal meatus

### The lacrimal gland  
#### Structure  
- The lacrimal gland is a bilobed tubulo-acinar exocrine gland that resides in the anterior supero-temporal aspect of the orbit and lies entirely behind the septum (**Fig. 1.30**).  
- It is, in essence, C-shaped. The lacrimal gland wraps around the lateral border of the aponeurosis of leva- tor palpebrae. Each lacrimal gland is divided into two lobes. The palpebral lobe sits below the aponeurosis and extends to the upper lid. The larger orbital lobe sits above the aponeurosis and lies within the lacrimal gland fossa. The lobes are continuous with each other (**Fig. 1.30**).  
- Despite being grossly divided into two lobes the lacrimal gland is largely an amorphous structure and possesses no strict capsule, although periorbita is believed to surround it.  
- Ducts arising from the orbital portion of the gland travel through the palpebral portion to drain into the conjuncti- val sac. There are approximately 12 of these ducts.  
- Ducts may also arise independently from the palpebral portion directly into the superior fornix  

- In addition to the main lacrimal gland there exist small accessory lacrimal glands, which reside in the conjunctiva concentrating in the fornices. The sheer number of these additional glands means that it is possible to maintain a sat- isfactory tear volume despite the removal of the main gland.  

#### Histology  

- As previously mentioned the lacrimal gland is a bilobed, lobulated, tubulo-acinar exocrine gland. Each lobule is sepa- rated by connective tissue.  

- Acini are small round masses of columnar epithelial secretory cells with a central lumen. In order to produce the relatively large quantities of aqueous tears, each acinus is rich in rough endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and mitochondria.  

- Lacrimal acini drain into lobular ducts that coalesce and then go on to drain into interlobular ducts. These ducts comprise a columnar or cuboidal epithelial lining with myo- epithelial cells in the periphery.  

#### Innervation 

##### Sympathetic  
- Sympathetic innervation arises with postganglionic fibres from the superior cervical sympathetic ganglion.  
- These move through the nerve plexus surrounding the internal carotid artery. They join the deep petrosal nerve, then the nerve of the pterygoid canal, then the maxil- lary nerve, the zygomatic nerve, the zygomaticotemporal nerve, and finally the lacrimal nerve.  

##### Parasympathetic  
- Parasympathetic supply arises from the lacrimal or lac- rimatory nucleus (a portion of the superior salivatory nucleus) of the facial nerve. This is a visceromotor cranial nerve nucleus located in the pontine tegmentum.  
- Preganglionic fibres are destined for synapse at the ptery- gopalatine ganglion. These fibres move from the lacrimal nucleus through the nervus intermedius and its great petrosal branch, then through the nerve of the ptery- goid canal to the pterygopalatine ganglion. Postgangli- onic fibres leave to join the maxillary nerve. These fibres move along the zygomatic branch of the maxillary, then the zygomaticotemporal nerve, then the lacrimal nerve to reach the lacrimal gland.  

##### Sensory  
- The sensory fibres are branches of the ophthalmic divi- sion of the trigeminal nerve. These reach the lacrimal gland, as with all lacrimal gland terminations, via the lacri- mal nerve.  

#### Lacrimal drainage  
- The lacrimal canaliculi appear as a pincer-like shape extend- ing from the lacrimal sac 

- Starting from the punctum, both canaliculi start with a 2 mm vertical path which then turns medially to become more hori- zontal (10 mm). At this point the canaliculi are still surrounded by fibres of the palpebral portion of the orbicularis oculi.  

- Both canaliculi then move posteriorly and combine, in most cases, to form a common canaliculus that lies behind the MPL. The common canaliculus then pierces the lacrimal sac 2.5 mm below its apex—see The lacrimal sac section.  

- From the sac, the nasolacrimal duct continues in an osse- ous canal (consisting solely of maxillary bone) that leads it in an inferior, posterior, lateral direction eventually exiting in the inferior meatus.  

- On blinking, the deep heads of the pretarsal muscles pull the lids medially, shortening the canaliculi. At the same time, the lacrimal fascia and sac wall are pulled laterally by the contraction of the deep heads of the preseptal muscle. As a result, the punctae close and the tears in the canaliculi are pulled medially and sucked into the sac. After the blink, the lacrimal fascia and sac move medially again and the lids move laterally. The puncta reopen and the canaliculi refill with tears. In this way, there is a lacrimal ‘pump’ that drains tears from the ocular surface to the lacrimal sac.  

#### The lacrimal sac  
- The lacrimal sac is around 12 mm long and is housed in the lacrimal groove or fossa (as opposed to the lacrimal gland fossa). This groove consists of the lacrimal bone and frontal process of maxilla.  

- CLINICAL TIP 
  > Important relations to the lacrimal sac when performing a dacrocystorhinostomy (DCR):  
  > - Upper portion of the lacrimal sac is bounded anteriorly by the MPL.  
  > - Posteriorly the upper sac is bound by the lacrimal part of the orbicularis oculi.  
  > - Medially the upper part of the lacrimal sac is related to the anterior ethmoid air cells.  
  > - The sac is covered laterally first by a venous plexus and then by the lacrimal fascia (formed from but distinct from periorbita). This occurs only between the anterior and posterior lacrimal crests.  
  > - The lower part of the lacrimal sac is medially related to the anterior middle meatus of the nose.  
  > NB The angular vein is an important structure to avoid when performing a DCR. It crosses the anterior surface of the MPL, lying around 8 mm medial to the medial canthus. 

## Ocular anatomy******  
### The conjunctiva  
#### Structure  
- The conjunctiva is a mucous membrane that covers both the globe and the internal lid surface—these are termed bulbar and palpebral conjunctiva, respectively. The palpebral con- junctiva attaches firmly to the interior lid surface.  

- Bulbar conjunctiva attaches firmly 1 mm posterior to the corneo-scleral junction. The rest of the bulbar conjunctiva lies loosely over the sclera, serving as a protective ‘sleeve’ and aiding globe movement.  

- Bulbar and palpebral conjunctiva meet in pockets known as the fornices (**Table 1.6**). There are superior, inferior, and lateral fornices. All forniceal conjunctiva is related directly to the extensions of the extraocular muscle sheaths (Tenon’s capsule), thus allowing the conjunctiva to be drawn towards the direction of eye movement without sagging.  

#### Histology  
- Conjunctival histology varies throughout its structure (**Table 1.7**). On the whole, conjunctiva may be summa- rized into two components: an underlying lamina propria and an accompanying epithelium (see **Table 1.7** for the differences).  

- Goblet cells feature heavily in conjunctival histology, reflect- ing its role in contributing mucus to the tear film. The goblet cells are found most frequently in the inferonasal bulbar conjunctiva.  

#### Conjunctival stem cells  

- Conjunctival epithelium has been shown to have self-renewing properties due to its population of stem cells. Conjunctival epithelial stem cells also play a significant role in tissue homeo- stasis but are intrinsically distinct from the limbal stem cells. In fact, the two have been shown to have distinctly separate lin- eages and, unlike corneal stem cells, conjunctival stem cells have been shown to be bipotent, producing both goblet and non-goblet epithelial cells.  

- The location of conjunctival stem cells remains under investigation but is thought to be predominantly in forniceal conjunctiva, which has been demonstrated in the murine model.  

#### Blood supply  
- Palpebral conjunctiva and peripheral bulbar conjunctiva are supplied by the same supply as the eyelids: the medial and lateral palpebral arteries.  

- The anterior ciliary arteries supply the bulbar conjunctiva more proximal to the limbus.  

- All conjunctival veins ultimately drain into the superior and inferior ophthalmic veins, which in turn drain into the cavernous sinus. Thrombosis of the cavernous sinus will therefore produce engorgement of conjunctival veins.  

#### Conjunctival-associated lymphoid tissue  
- The conjunctiva is a mucosal tissue rich in lymphatic drain- age. It contains focal aggregations of lymphoid tissue known as conjunctival-associated lymphoid tissue (CALT), which is part of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT).  

- MALT refers to specialized lymphoid tissue that exists in most mucosal surfaces and differs from primary lymphoid tissues (spleen and lymph nodes) in its structure, location, and cellular composition. The highly specialized MALT epi- thelium has developed a significant role in antigen uptake and processing. For example, MALT contains specialized epithelial cells with unique apical microfolds, known as M cells. These cells are able to engulf and deliver antigens to neighbouring antigen-presenting cells. The absence of gob- let cells within MALT also permits a reduction in the mucin layer, allowing MALT epithelium to gain better access to antigen.  

- Ocular MALT components include the conjunctiva, lacri- mal gland, tear film, and cornea. CALT plays a key role in local active immunity and in developing immune tolerance. Aside from the conjunctiva, the lacrimal gland and the tear film are other components of CALT.  

#### Lymphatic drainage  
- The conjunctival lymph vessels are an anastomotic network divided into superficial and deep plexuses that lie in the sub- mucosa.  

- The small lymph vessels of the bulbar conjunctiva arise 1 mm peripheral to the limbus and join to form larger vessels in the substantia propria, which then drain towards the palpebral commissures. There, they join the lymphatic drainage of the palpebral conjunctiva and the eyelid. The lymph vessels of the lateral half of the lid drain into the preauricular (intraparotid) node system, whereas the medial half drains into the submandibular lymph nodes.  

#### Innervation  
- Bulbar conjunctiva: long ciliary nerves (these are branches of the nasociliary nerves—part of the ophthalmic divi- sion of the trigeminal, V1).  
- Superior palpebral conjunctiva and superior fornix: fron- tal and lacrimal branches of V1.  
- Lateral inferior palpebral conjunctiva and lateral fornix: lacrimal branch of V1.  
- Nasal inferior palpebral conjunctiva and nasal fornix: infraorbital nerve of V2.

---

### The caruncle  
- The medial angle of the lid aperture typically lies around 6 mm medial to the globe as opposed to the lateral angle, which is in direct contact with the globe.  

- At the medial angle there lies a small pink triangle of tis- sue that contains the ‘lake of tears’ or lacus lacrimalis, i.e. the pool of tears that sits in the inner canthus. The medial fleshy elevation of the lacus is known as the caruncle or caruncula lacrimalis.  

- The flat lateral fold of the lacus lacrimalis is known as the plica semilunaris due to its half-moon shape (Latin plica, meaning fold or corrugation).  

- Histologically the caruncle is of modified skin containing sebaceous glands whilst its surface is of non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium.  

---

### The cornea  
####
- The cornea is the transparent layer of the anterior seg- ment of the eye. The cornea, and in particular the interface between air and its anterior surface, has the greatest refrac- tive index of the ocular optical system and, using its own structural rigidity, aids the formation of the anterior chamber.  

#### Dimensions  
- The cornea itself is shorter vertically than it is horizontally. On average, the vertical measurement is 10.6 mm where- as the horizontal central diameter averages 11.7 mm. However, despite the difference of approximately 1.1 mm, the circumference of the cornea is circular when viewed posteriorly.  

- The cornea is also thinner centrally (0.52 mm) than it is peripherally (up to 1.1 mm at the limbus). Optically the cornea is described as aspheric because its radius of curvature varies from apex to limbus. Also, there is a difference between the anterior radius of curvature and the posterior radius of curva- ture, which are 7.8 and 6.5 mm, respectively. Quite often the vertical meridian is more convex than the horizontal.  

#### Structure  

#####
- The cornea itself comprises five major layers (beginning anteriorly):

  1. the corneal epithelium  
  2. Bowman’s layer (anterior limiting lamina)  
  3. corneal stroma (substantia propria)  
  4. Descemet’s membrane (posterior limiting lamina)  
  5. corneal endothelium  

##### Epithelium  
- The corneal epithelium is the outermost layer and forms the air–tear film interface. It is formed of stratified squamous and columnar epithelial cells that regenerate quickly at the limbus. The squamous epithelial strata exists more anterior to the columnar cells.  

- Centrally, the epithelium is composed of five to six cell layers that are held together laterally by desmosomes and to the underlying foundation that is the basal lamina by hemidesmosomes. Peripherally, the epithelium is of roughly 10 cell layers.  

- The thickness of the corneal epithelium typically lies between 50 and 60 μm.  

- Unlike the corneal endothelium, the epithelium is able to regenerate rapidly. Mitotic activity generates new cells from the basal lamina at the limbus. New cells are said to exhibit amoeboid sliding movements, which displace existing cells superficially and centripetally towards the centre of the cornea.  

- The basal epithelia lie on a distinct basal lamina that resides between the corneal epithelium and Bowman’s layer. This can be further divided into two classes: lamina lucida 25 nm and lamina densa 50 nm. The corneal epitheli- um is anchored to Bowman’s layer through a complex mesh of connecting tissues via the basal lamina, known as anchor- ing fibrils (collagen type VII) and anchoring plaques (collagen type VI). These interact with the lamina densa and the col- lagen fibrils of Bowman’s layer to secure the epithelium to Bowman’s layer.  

- There are also several groups of non-epithelial cells that appear within the corneal epithelium. These include lym- phocytes, macrophages, pigmented melanocytes, and wan- dering histocytes.  

- Antigen-presenting Langerhans’ cells are derived from bone marrow macrophage precursors and are located in the limbus and the peripheral cornea, but are usually absent in the central third of the cornea. Langerhans’ cells migrate centripetally in response to trauma and infection but also as part of the ageing process.  

##### Bowman’s layer  
- Bowman’s layer is an acellular region of connective tissue that is randomly spaced and consists of collagen fibrils of types I, III, V, and VI. It ranges in diameter from 20 to 30 nm.  

##### Stroma (substantia propria)  
- By contrast to Bowman’s layer, the stroma consists of very regular connective tissue. The substantia propria provides the majority of the cornea (approximately 90%). Despite its thickness, the corneal stroma is transparent for two reasons:  
  1. The regular arrangement of the collagen fibres in a lattice allows for destructive interference of light. Therefore light scattered by one lattice is cancelled out by similar scattering from an adjacent lattice.  
  2. The spacing between each lattice has a critical limit by which transparency can occur (< 200 nm).  

- Anatomically, the corneal stroma consists of 2-μm-thick flattened collagen fibres (collagenous lamellae), which are made up of 200–250 layers and run parallel to the corneal surface. Between the layers of lamellae lie modified stellate fibroblasts, which are keratocytes by classification and are the source of the lamellae.  

- There are around 2.4 million keratocytes within the cor- nea and they occupy between 3 and 5% of the stromal volume. They are most dense in the anterior cornea and are bound together by gap junctions. Histologically, keratocytes have abundant mitochondria, rough endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus. Most of the substance of the corneal stroma is composed of a glycosaminoglycan-keratan matrix.  

##### Descemet’s membrane  
- Descemet’s membrane is a basement membrane of the corneal endothelium and is generally rich in type IV collagen. This membrane is roughly 8–10 μm thick and its structure is based on two parts, both of which stain periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) positive and are rich in type IV collagen:  
  1. the anterior third  
  2. the posterior two-thirds  

- The anterior third is a banded region that is also said to include type VIII collagen, and types V and VI collagen at the stromal–Descemet’s interface. This may have a stabilizing role, providing adherence between the layers. The anterior third develops in utero.  

- The posterior two-thirds are the non-banded region and are laid down by the corneal endothelial cells throughout life. Peripherally, Descemet’s membrane runs continuously with the cortical zone of the trabecular meshwork, ending at Schwalbe’s line.  

##### Endothelium  
- The endothelium is a single-layered structure consisting of flattened polygonal cells and measuring around 15 μm thick. The free surface of these cells contains microvilli.  

- The cells cover the posterior face of Descemet’s mem- brane and are continuous with the endothelial lining of the tracheal meshwork and the anterior cells of the iris.  

- One of the most important functions of the endothelium is to maintain a relative state of corneal dehydration by means of an active transport mechanism. This mechanism is supported by the abundance of mitochondria, rough endo- plasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus in the endothelial cytoplasm. The endothelium also prevents aqueous from entering the stroma by acting as a barrier aided by its tight cell–cell junctions.  

- Should the endothelium become damaged, the cells do not regenerate but simply further flatten themselves to cover a larger surface area. This unfortunately provides a critical limit to which they operate. In Fuch’s endothelial dys- trophy there is a loss of endothelial cells, which can lead to stromal oedema and epithelial bullae.  

#### Blood supply  

- The cornea is a rare body structure in that it is devoid of vasculature and lymphatic supply. The capillaries descending from the anterior ciliary arteries of the conjunctiva and sclera terminate as they reach the cornea.  

- The cornea receives its nourishment from the capillaries at its boundaries and, when the eye is open, indirectly from the oxygen dissolved in the tear film. When the eye is closed, it receives oxygen by diffusion from the lid vascula- ture and posteriorly from the aqueous.  

- Another feature of the limbal connective tissue is the peg-like outpockets of stroma known as rete. These lie between the ridges of the palisades and extend from the peripheral cornea through the limbus to the conjunctiva. It is thought that the rete contribute to the adhesion strength of the epithelial cells.  

#### The anatomical limbus  

- The anatomical limbus takes up an arc as it traverses the tis- sues in an anterior to posterior manner and begins roughly 1 mm posterior to the conjunctival limbus. Schwalbe’s line marks the posterior limit to the anatomical limbus.  

- Two grooves belie the anterior and posterior extremes of the limbal arc. The external scleral sulcus lies at the ante- rior aspect of the limbal arc.  

- The internal scleral sulcus lies at the posterior aspect of the limbal arc. It is this sulcus that contains the canal of Sch- lemm and the trabecular meshwork.  

#### The surgical limbus  
- The surgical limbus lies slightly anterior to the anatomical limbus.  

  It is considered in two parts:  
  1. a blue/grey line that overlies clear cornea and extends from Bowman’s layer to Schwalbe’s line  
  2. a posterior white zone that includes the trabecular meshwork and extending from Schwalbe’s line to the scleral spur  

#### The pathological limbus  
- The pathological limbus is more of a section of corneo- scleral tissue. By joining an imaginary line between the peripheral terminations of Bowman’s layer and Descemet’s membrane, one creates the anterior wall of the pathological limbus. The posterior wall is formed by a line 1.5 mm poste- rior to the termination of Bowman’s layer, which is perpen- dicular to the eye’s surface.  

### The sclera  
####
- The sclera is a tough, relatively avascular casing that encompasses the globe. It begins anteriorly as a continua- tion of the cornea, and runs posteriorly (internal to the conjunctiva) to finish by fusing with the dural sheath of the optic nerve.  

- The thickest point of the sclera is at the posterior pole, where it measures 1 mm. The sclera then thins to little more than 0.6 mm at the equator. However, the thinnest regions of the sclera lie directly behind the insertion of the extra- ocular muscles, where the sclera measures around 0.3 mm in thickness.  

- The sclera is penetrated by four types of structure:  
  1. the optic nerve and fibres  
  2. anterior ciliary arteries  
  3. ciliary nerves  
  4. vortex veins  

- The optic nerve attaches to the sclera approximately 3 mm medial and 1 mm superior to the anatomical posterior pole. As the optic nerve head abuts the globe, the sclera becomes perforated to accommodate the penetration of the nerve fibres. This area of perforated sclera is known as the lamina cribrosa.  

- The anterior ciliary arteries pierce the sclera at the insertion of each of the rectus muscles. There are two arteries for every rectus muscle, except the lateral rectus, which has only one. The oblique muscles do not contribute to the anterior arterial circle, which is why it is possible to recess an oblique muscle whilst operating on two other rectus muscles without inducing anterior ocular ischaemic syndrome.  

- The long and short ciliary nerves pierce the sclera next to the optic nerve head and travel anteriorly within the peri- choroidal space.  

- The vortex veins pierce sclera 4 mm posterior to the equator. There are two vortex veins in the superior hemi- sphere as well as another two within the inferior hemisphere.  

#### Layers of the sclera  

- The sclera comprises three layers:  
  1. episclera  
  2. stroma  
  3. lamina fusca  

- The episclera is the external layer of sclera lying just internal to, and in certain sites connected to, the tenon’s capsule. It comprises a vascular network supplied by the anterior ciliary arteries and loose connective tissue.  

- The scleral stroma is formed by an arrangement of assorted fibrous collagen fibrils and elastic fibres. The colla- gen tends to be of types I and III and varies in diameter (28–280 μm). Unlike the cornea, it is the randomness of the interweaving of these collagen fibres that is largely respon- sible for the opacity of the sclera.  

- The lamina fusca (Latin for brown) is the deepest layer of the sclera. It is so named because of the occurrence of melanocytes along its body. The lamina fusca lies just exte- rior to the choroid and has numerous weak collagenous attachments between the two.  

  > **CLINICAL TIP**  
  > Differentiating episcleritis from scleritis  
  > The episcleral vessels are typically constricted by topical phenylephrine but not by topical adrenaline. This may be used to distinguish between episcleritis and scleritis as deep inflamed scleral vessels will not constrict with topical phenylephrine alone.  

  Conversely, the relative thinning of the capsule is demon- strated clearly in cataract surgery, where the risk of ruptur- ing the posterior capsule is always present.

### The lens  

#### Dimensions and growth  

- The lens is an ever-growing structure within the eye, starting with an equatorial diameter of 6.5 mm and a thickness of around 3 mm at birth. The typical adult human lens mea- sures approximately 10 mm in diameter and 4 mm in thick- ness in its relaxed state.  

- The lens is defined as a ‘positive’ lens by its biconvex shape. It accounts for around 30% of the eye’s refractive power (roughly 15 dioptres). The posterior surface of the lens tends to be more convex than the anterior surface, and the circumference where the two convex surfaces meet determines the equator. The apices of each convex surface are known as the poles (anterior and posterior).  

- The growth of the lens throughout life reduces the ante- rior radius of curvature, thus increasing its power to con- verge light. Ordinarily, this would lead to the development of myopia if not for the changes in the lens material leading to a compensatory change in refractive power over time.  

#### Cross-section of the lens 

- The capsule consists of an elastic basement membrane, which is rich in type IV collagen and is produced by the lens epithelium. Fine filaments arranged in lamellae form the capsule by placing themselves parallel to the surface, adding to its strength. Laminin has also been discovered within the anterior capsule; this is absent in the posterior capsule.  

- To account for the ever-increasing size of the lens, the synthesis of the anterior capsule also continues throughout life whereas the posterior capsule remains essentially con- stant. This may explain the increase in anterior convexity later in life.  

- The capsule becomes relatively thickened either side of the equator, sparing the poles and the equator itself.  

#### Lens epithelium  
#####
- The lens epithelium forms a sheet a few cells thick and resides behind the anterior capsule only. The apices of the lens epithelia face towards the nucleus and their basal aspect lies directly on the capsule. Laterally, adjacent cells interdigitate with each other, forming multiple ‘tongue and groove’ connections. These connections obliterate any gaps between epithelial cells. Other important qualities of the lens epithelial cells include large nuclei, but relatively few cytoplasmic organelles.  

##### Regional distinctions between lens epithelial cells  
- Depending on the location, lens epithelium exhibits differ- ent characteristics. The following are the most obvious changes:  
  - Morphology—centrally, lens epithelial cells are typically cuboidal in shape at the anterior pole but become more columnar on reaching the equator.  
  - Mitotic activity—cells that lie in the central zone typically show a stable population with a very slow rate of decline. Just outside this area lies an intermediate zone, which contains smaller epithelial cells that display occasional mitotic activity.  
  - At the pre-equatorial areas, the epithelial cells form a ‘germinative’ zone. It is at the equator that lens epithelial mitotic activity is at its maximum.  

#### Lens fibres  
- The lens fibres make up the main mass of the lens. They are formed by multiplication and differentiation of the lens epithelial cells at the equator, which continues throughout life.  

- Lens epithelium New lens fibres	Anterior pole	Capsule Embryonic nucleus Fetal nucleus Adult nucleus  

- Posterior pole: The lens in equatorial view showing the different nuclei within the lens cortex.  

- The cells begin to elongate along the internal surface of the lens in a posterior direction. As the apical part of the lens epithelial cell elongates posteriorly, it slips beneath the internal surface of adjacent lens cells.  

- As this happens, the nuclei move anteriorly to form the classical convex nuclear pattern known as the ‘lens bow’.  

- Each elongated lens cell is now called a lens fibre. This is a hexagonal prism in cross-section and is around 10 mm long. The fibres run meridionally from the posterior to the ante- rior lens surface and are U-shaped. The earliest formed fibres are those in the centre or nucleus of the lens. The outer fibres in the cortex are formed later.  

- As they bend around the nucleus to towards the anterior pole, the laterally opposing secondary fibres within the same layer connect to form the classical Y suture. The pos- teriorly elongating fibres curve around the nucleus and join just within the posterior pole to form an inverted Y or lamb- da (λ)-shaped suture (think L for last)  

- The lens fibres themselves have a few small vesicles, microfilaments, microtubules, and occasional mitochondri- on in their cytoplasm. The fibres are packed tightly with very little intercellular space. There is interlocking of adjacent plasma membranes in the form of ball-and-socket type joints. These interactions are significantly less complicated in the superficial zones of the lens, and this may permit mould- ing of the lens shape during accommodation.  

- Lens fibres can exist at a distance from a circulation because of the high number of gap junctions they possess. This makes the lens a syncytium and this is the reason why the lens acts as a single cell.  

#### Zonule (suspensory ligament)  
- The zonules are individual fibrous structures that attach to the external peri-equatorial areas of the lens in a radial pat- tern. They are derived from the basal laminae of the non- pigmented ciliary epithelium along both the pars plana and the pars plicata.  

- Each zonule consists of multiple tightly packed fibrillin fila- ments which integrate with the lens capsule.  

- Naturally, any weakening of the zonules may risk the sub- luxation of the lens. Such conditions include Marfan’s syn- drome and homocysteinuria.  

- When viewing distant objects the zonules are under max- imal tension to flatten the lens. Conversely, when viewing near objects, the ciliary muscle contraction causes forward and inward movement of the ciliary zonule attachments. This relaxes the zonule tension to allow the lens to resume its natural, more convex shape.  

### The iris  
#### Gross structure and cross-section  

- The iris is a contractile, tympanic-like structure with a cen- tral aperture—the pupil. The iris forms a wall between the cornea and the lens, separating the aqueous into two com- partments: the anterior chamber (between cornea and iris) and the posterior chamber (between iris and lens).  

- In cross-section, the iris consists of:  
  - the anterior stroma  
  - a posterior bilayer of epithelium  

#### Anterior stroma  
#####
- The stroma consists of the muscle layer, connective tissue (containing a vascular network and collagen), and nerve fibres.  

- Looking directly at the iris anteriorly, it is divided into two zones (**Fig. 1.35**):  
  1. the pupillary zone  
  2. the ciliary zone  

- The pupillary zone lies between the ruff and the collarette. The ruff is the absolute inner limit of the pupil and frequent- ly it is possible to see the termination of the posterior pig- mented layer of the iris slightly protruding from behind the pupil (a marked protrusion of the pigmented layer is termed ectropion uvea).  

- The collarette is the thickest structure of the iris and lies around 2 mm peripheral to the pupil margin.  

- Within the pupillary zone lies the sphincter pupillae. These concentrically arranged autonomic smooth muscle fibres cause pupil constriction. The muscle cells are con- nected by gap junctions and arranged in bundles that are separated by connective tissue carrying a blood and nerve supply. They are supplied by parasympathetic fibres from the short ciliary nerves derived from the oculomotor nerve.  

- The ciliary zone continues from the collarette until it reaches the iris root. Within this region lies the dilator pupil- lae muscle, which, as the name suggests, acts as the antago- nist to the sphincter by dilating the pupil. The dilator is composed of myoepithelial cells that, again, are connected to each other by gap junctions. These cells form a thin flat sheet that arises, embryologically, from the basal processes of anterior iris epithelium, posteriorly. The postganglionic sympathetic fibres from the superior cervical sympathetic ganglion make up the efferent supply to the dilator pupillae. These fibres reach the dilator through the long ciliary nerves and implant upon the myoepithelial plasma membrane as unmyelinated fibres.  

##### Posterior bilayer of epithelium  
- The epithelium is divided into a posterior pigmented layer and an anterior non-pigmented layer of cuboidal cells.  

- The two layers of iris epithelium lie apex-to-apex and are an extension of the ciliary epithelium and both draw simi- larities to each other. The pigmented ciliary epithelium is continuous with the anterior non-pigmented iris epithelium. Likewise, the non-pigmented ciliary epithelium is continuous with the posterior pigmented iris epithelium.  

#### Blood supply  
- The major blood supply to both the iris and the ciliary body is from the major arterial arcade. Along- side the two long posterior ciliary arteries, the seven ante- rior ciliary arteries supply the major arterial arcade—one artery from the lateral rectus and two from the remaining recti. The two long posterior ciliary arteries travel anteri- orly through the choroid to anastomose with the major arterial arcade.  

- Smaller arteries branch off the major arterial arcade in a radial pattern towards the pupil margin. On reaching the pupillary zone, these smaller arteries form an incomplete minor arterial circle.  

- Similarly, the venous structure also creates a minor venous circle. However, instead of forming a major venous arcade, the veins coalesce to eventually flow out of the vor- ticose (or vortex) veins.  

- All vessels within the iris are non-fenestrated and do con- tain tight junctions between the vascular endothelial cells. However, this is a pseudo-blood–ocular barrier as in times of inflammation the vessels will leak protein and other white cells. White cells may diapedese out of these vessels.  

### The ciliary body (the ‘hairy body’)  

#### Structure  
- The ciliary body is a continuation of the uveal tract, the other components of which are the iris and choroid. It per- forms three main functions:  
- aqueous formation (see Chapter 2, Lens and accommodation.)  
- lens accommodation  
- aqueous drainage via the uveoscleral outflow and trabec- ular system (see Chapter 2, Lens and accommodation.)  

- Macroscopically, the ciliary body is a torus in shape and broadly triangular in cross-section, measuring 6–7 mm in width. The iris projects from the ciliary body base whereas the apex of the ciliary body continues towards the ora ser- rata. In addition, the base of the ciliary body marks its only anchor to the sclera, where the ciliary body’s longitudinal muscle strands insert directly into the scleral spur.  

- There are three main components to the ciliary body:  
  1. the stroma  
  2. the muscle  
  3. the epithelium  

- The ciliary body may also be divided into two areas:  
  1. pars plana  
  2. pars plicata  

- The pars plicata is highly vascularized in nature. Its rough appearance is created by the ciliary processes (hence the name ciliary). Here, the ciliary epithelium is thrown into multiple folds, maximizing its surface area. The troughs of the ciliary processes are the primary site of attachment for the lens zonules, although some also insert into the pars plana.  

- The pars plana measures approximately 4 mm and appears as a relatively avascular, pigmented region that lies between the ora serrata and the ciliary processes of the pars plicata. A trans-pars plana approach is the safest point of entry into the vitreous cavity and is estimated to be around 3–4 mm behind the limbus.  

#### Ciliary body epithelium  
- The ciliary epithelium consists of a bilayer of cuboidal epithelial cells—a pigmented layer and a non-pigmented layer. The apices of both cell layers connect with each other and both play a principal role in aqueous humour formation.  

#### Non-pigmented ciliary body epithelium  
- The non-pigmented epithelium represents the innermost half of the two layers. Its basal lamina lies in direct contact with the aqueous humour and is continuous with the inter- nal limiting membrane of the retina and the posterior pig- mented layer of the iris epithelium.  

- The morphology of the non-pigmented cells changes depending on location. The cells that are at the pars plana region are predominantly cuboidal, whereas those at the pars plicata tend to be columnar.  

- The non-pigmented epithelium is abundant in Golgi apparatus and rough endoplasmic reticulum to support its function as a producer of aqueous humour. They also have far less melanosomes compared with the pigmented counterpart. However, both pigmented and non-pigment- ed cells contain basal infoldings, mitochondria, and large nuclei.  

- Between the lateral border of adjacent non-epithelial cell apices are numerous tight junctions (zonulae occludentes). These tight junctions constitute one portion of the blood aqueous barrier.  

- There are differences between the non-pigmented epi- thelial cells at the tips of the ciliary processes and those between these. The cells at the tips are designed for fluid secretion and those in the valleys are designed for tetherinig zonular fibres.  

#### Pigmented ciliary body epithelium  
- The basal lamina of the pigmented epithelium is thicker and more homogenous compared to that of the non-pigmented layer and faces the stroma. The basal lamina here is also continuous with the retinal pigment epithelium.  

- The cells of this layer tend to be cuboidal throughout the pars plana and pars plicata, and have abundant melanosomes.  

#### Ciliary body stroma  

- The ciliary stroma is a collection of loose connective tissue where the main vascular supply is found. The stroma also houses the embedded ciliary muscle. This connective tissue runs through each ciliary process to form a connective tis- sue core. A capillary plexus also runs in each ciliary process, the vascular tone of which plays a role in determining regional blood flow and hydrostatic capillary pressure. This can influence the surface area of the ciliary epithelium and therefore how much area may be available for fluid exchange.  

#### Ciliary body muscle  

- The origin of the ciliary muscle anteriorly is at the sclera spur by Schlemm’s canal, which acts as a fixed anchor against which ciliary muscle contracts. The posterior attachment of the ciliary muscle is to the stroma of the choroid. The ante- rior and inner surfaces of the ciliary muscle are bounded anteriorly by the stroma of the pars plicata and posteriorly by the pars plana of the ciliary body. Hence contraction of the ciliary muscle causes forward and inward movement of the ciliary body. As the ciliary body muscles contract, the zonules loosen, allowing the lens to retain a more convex shape (which is of a higher refractive order than when it is under tension) and thus accommodation occurs.  

- The ciliary muscle is within the ciliary body and is com- posed of three muscle fibre groups. These are orientated longitudinally, radially, and circularly. The largest group is the longitudinal muscle fibres (Brücke’s muscle), which are attached between the sclera spur and the choroid. Inward to these are the radial fibres, which are attached anteriorly to the sclera spur and then to the insertion of the iris and the elastic tendons of the choroid. Beneath these, the radial (circular) fibres are positioned more anteriorly in the ciliary body and closest to the lens. The three muscle fibre groups are closely related and contract together to bring about accommodation.  

- The ciliary muscle receives its innervation from the post- ganglionic parasympathetic fibres of the oculomotor (CN 3) nerve. These pass through the short ciliary nerves to reach the ciliary body.  

#### Blood supply  

- The major arterial circle is derived from the long posterior ciliary arteries. The vasculature of the ciliary body is fenes- trated (unlike that of the iris).  


### The choroid  
- The choroid is the posterior part of the uveal tract.  

- The choroid lies in between the retinal pigment epitheli- um (RPE) in the retina and the sclera, and serves to provide the outer third of the retina with nutrients. It is attached to the sclera at two sites: the site of exit of the vortex veins and the optic nerve head, where the choroid becomes con- tinuous with the pia and arachnoid. The choroid is smooth on the inner surface and rough externally.  

- The choroidal capillaries are most dense at the macula and fovea. The foveal avascular zone defines a region in which there is no retinal arterial supply. This area is supplied exclusively by the choroid.  

- The choroid may be broken down into two components: Bruch’s membrane and a vascular layer.  

  > **CLINICAL TIP**  
  > In degenerative conditions such as age-related macula degeneration, Bruch’s membrane may be breached and new vessels may pass through under the retina from the choroid.  

### Bruch’s membrane  
####
- Bruch’s membrane is a broadly homogenous structure com- prising five layers and measuring 2–4 μm thick. The most inter- nal layer is the basement membrane of the RPE. The most external layer consists of the basement membrane to the cho- riocapillaris. The middle three layers comprise elastic fibres.  

- Although the exact role for Bruch’s membrane is not clear, it is thought that it may play a part in fluid transport from choroid to retina.  

#### The vascular layer  
The vascular layer is subdivided into three layers graded by successive vascular calibre:  
  - a capillary layer  
  - a medium vessel layer  
  - a large vessel layer  

- The capillary layer is known as the choriocapillaris and occu- pies the innermost vascular layer. The choriocapillaris is a specialized continuous network of large (40–60 μm in diam- eter) capillaries lying in the plane directly external to Bruch’s membrane. The distinctive feature of these vessels is their walls, which are thin and have numerous fenestrations, especially on the side that faces the RPE. The vessel walls do exhibit pericytes on their external surface, which helps to contribute to wall integrity. Each capillary displays a wide- bore lumen, which is widest at the macula.  

- External to the choriocapillaris is the middle layer of small to medium vessels and finally outside this there is a large vessel layer. These medium and large vessels have similari- ties with small vessels in the rest of the body in that both contain an internal elastic lamina and a smooth muscle media.  

#### Blood supply  
- The suprachoroidal space occupies the plane between choroid and sclera. It is in this plane that the choroid receives its blood and nerve supply. The two long poste- rior ciliary arteries, the short posterior ciliary arteries, and the perforating anterior ciliary arteries perfuse the choroid.  

- The blood leaves the choriocapillaris via complementary choroidal veins, which drain into the vortex veins. This venous blood eventually flows into the ophthalmic vein.  

#### Nerve supply  
- The long ciliary nerves carry sensory and sympathetic fibres and are branches of the nasociliary nerve, which are derived from a branch of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve.  
- The short ciliary nerves carry both sympathetic and para- sympathetic information and project from the ciliary gan- glion.  

- Both long and short ciliary nerves penetrate the sclera around the optic nerve head and travel anteriorly through the suprachoroidal space.  

#### Summary of functions of the choroid  

- Nourishment—as mentioned earlier, the choroid gives nutrition to the posterior third of the retina and carries a blood supply forward to the anterior of the globe.  
- Light trap and heat sink—owing to the high melanocyte content, the pigmentation of the choroid is profound and serves as a ‘light sink’, preventing unwanted rays being reflected back on to the retina.  

- Blood flow in the choroid is particularly fast, so much so that only around 2–3% of arterial oxygen leaves the arteries. It is thought that this level of flow may help in heat extraction from the globe, thus counteracting the heat generated from absorbing light.  

### The retina  
####

- The retina forms the internal layer of the eyeball. This is the site of photochemical transduction, where nerve impulses are created and transmitted along visual pathways to the brain for higher cortical processing.  

- The thickness of the retina varies from 0.56 mm near the optic disc to 0.1 mm at the ora serrata. Its thinnest point is at the fovea.  

- The outer surface of the retina is in contact with Bruch’s membrane of the choroid and the inner surface is in contact with the vitreous body. An approximate landmark for the ora serrata (anterior edge/termination of the retina) is the insertion of the medial rectus muscle medially and the lat- eral rectus muscle laterally.  

- Anteriorly, the retina becomes continuous with the pig- mented and non-pigmented columnar cell layers of the cili- ary body.  

- In cross-section, the retina forms an inner neurosensory layer and an outer pigmented layer (RPE) which is derived from neuroectoderm. There are ten layers to the retina: nine layers of the neurosensory retina coupled with the single RPE layer. The layers are (starting from inside out) (**Fig. 1.37**):  
  1. inner limiting membrane (ILM)—formed by the amal- gamation of the inner foot processes of Müller cells  
  2. nerve fibre layer  
  3. ganglion cell layer  
  4. inner plexiform layer  
  5. inner nuclear layer  
  6. outer plexiform layer  
  7. outer nuclear layer  
  8. external limiting membrane (ELM) formed by the amal- gamation of the outer foot processes of Müller cells and adherens junctions with the photoreceptor outer segments  
  9. photoreceptor layer  
  10. retinal pigment epithelium layer  

#### Inner limiting membrane  
- The ILM and the ELM are both layers that are formed by the amalgamation of the inner and outer foot processes of Mül- ler cells, respectively.  

- The Müller cells themselves are the main neuroglial cell in the retina, are analogous to the oligodendrocytes in the cen- tral nervous system, and are derived from neuroectoderm. Müller cells are arranged radially in the retina and, as alluded to previously, they extend from the ILM as far as the ELM. Their processes as well as Müller cell basement mem- branes contribute to the ILM.  

- There are blood vessels that pass within the layers of the neurosensory retina and neither the ELM nor the ILM take any part of the blood ocular barrier.  

- Other neuroglial cells in the retina include astrocytes, which are less common and reside mostly between the gan- glion cell layer and the inner nuclear layer. Both these cells are responsible for creating the fibroglial scars seen when there is an insult to the retina. Gliosis is the mechanism by which the retina heals.  

#### The ganglion cell layer  
- The ganglion cell layer comprises the bodies of ganglion cells. These ganglion cells serve as the last retinal integrator of information before leaving via the nerve fibres in the nerve fibre layer.  
- Parasol ganglion cells or M-cells (taken from the mag- nocellular layer they project into the lateral geniculate nucleus) integrate information from a large receptive field, namely from several photoreceptors.  
- Midget ganglion cells or P-cells (taken from the par- vocellular layer, they project into the lateral geniculate nucleus) make connections with only one amacrine cell and one midget bipolar cell. This means that the information sent through this system is often from a single cone, allowing for more detailed information to be sent.  
- Midget ganglion cells and midget bipolar cells are more common near the fovea.  
- On exit, nerve fibres are ensheathed by glial cells and myelinated only after exiting the globe (hence the conical shape of the optic nerve head). They will next synapse at the lateral geniculate nucleus in the thalamus.  

#### Inner and outer plexiform layers  
- The characteristic feature of the plexiform layers is the absence or distinct reduction of cell bodies. The major com- ponents of any plexiform layer in the retina are either:  
  - nerve axons or  
  - cell processes  

- The inner plexiform layer comprises the processes of bipo- lar, amacrine, and ganglion cells. Naturally, this layer serves to communicate information between the inner nuclear layer and the ganglion cell layer.  

- Similarly, the outer plexiform layer contains photorecep- tor and bipolar axons, and the processes of horizontal cells. These serve as a communication between the outer and inner nuclear layers.  

#### The inner nuclear layer  
- This layer contains the cell bodies of the bipolar, amacrine, horizontal, and Müller cells.  
- Bipolar cells connect in a radial fashion, usually from photoreceptor to synapse with ganglion cells. One or more dendrites from the bipolar cells pass outward to synapse with the photoreceptor cell terminals. The sin- gle axon is directed inward to synapse with ganglion and amacrine cells. There are several types of bipolar cell:  
  - rod bipolar cells—connect several rod cells to one to four ganglion cells  
  - flat or diffuse bipolar cells—connect many cone cells to many ganglion cells  
  - midget bipolar cells—connect a single cone cell with a single midget ganglion cell  
- Amacrine cells connect amacrine to ganglion and ganglion to ganglion cells. This ensures that laterally placed gan- glion cells are excited. They also modulate photoreceptor signals by their neurotransmitter content.  
- Horizontal cells are situated close to the terminal expan- sions of rods and cones. They are multipolar cells with one long (up to 1 mm in length) and several short processes, which run both horizontally and parallel with the retinal surface. They connect in a horizontal fashion, mostly inte- grating information between the bipolar–photoreceptor synapses. The horizontal cells associated with cones have short processes that synapse with around seven cone pedicles. The horizontal cells associated with rods have longer processes that synapse with 10–12 rod spherules. These then make contact with bipolar cells some distance away. The horizontal cells release gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in response to stimulation by the photo- receptor. This inhibits the activity of bipolar cells, thus increasing contrast and spatial resolution.  
- Müller cells are similar to neuroglial cells. They are long, narrow, and pale-staining. They have long processes that run almost the entire thickness of the neural retina. Branches extend out horizontally and surround and sup- port the neighbouring nerve cells. As well as forming an integral part of the ILM and ELM, these cells make exten- sive contacts with blood vessels in the retina, taking part in the structure of the blood–ocular barrier.  

#### The outer nuclear layer  
- The outer nuclear layer contains the nuclei of the photore- ceptors. These nuclei are separated from their respective photoreceptor bodies by the ELM.  

#### Photoreceptors  
- There are two types of photoreceptors: rods and cones (**Fig. 1.38**). The rods are responsible for vision in dim light and give images in black and white. Cones are adapted for bright light and resolve fine details and colour vision.  

- There are approximately 120 million rods in the entire retina. There are no rods at the fovea and the number increases until the maximum density occurs in the juxtafo- veal zone, about 160,000 cells/mm2. This density reduces gradually to 30,000 cells/mm2 in the peripheral retina.  

- There are around 6–7 million cones in the retina and their density is concentrated in the fovea, which has approximate- ly 160,000 cells/mm2. This figure declines rapidly to 5000 cells/mm2 at around 10°s from the fovea.  

- Rod cells are slender and long (100–120 μm long). It is the outer segment that is the true photoreceptor of the cell and contains the photosensitive pigment, rhodopsin. Each outer segment contains 600 to 1000 transversely arranged membrane-bound ‘discs’, which are around 2 μm wide, 14 nm thick, and stacked one above another like a pile of coins. Rhodopsin is arranged within these membranes.  

- The connecting stalk that joins the outer segment to the cell body contains a modified cilium, which consists of about nine doublet microtubules but no central pair. This origi- nates in the basal body found in the inner segment.  

- The inner segment consists of two areas:  
  - ellipsoid—next to the connecting stalk  
  - myoid—towards the vitreous  

- The ellipsoid contains the basal body, with numerous mito- chondria, and the myoid contains the granular and agranular endoplasmic reticulum, free ribosomes, and a Golgi apparatus. The rod outer fibre joins the inner segment to the cell body and the inner fibre joins the cell body to the pear- shaped spherule.  

- Cone cells are also long and slender (65–75 μm long) and have a structure similar to the rods. The differences are that the outer segment is conical and wider than the rod at its base. The membranes of the discs are continu- ous with the outer cell plasma membrane and so the outer segment in rods is continuous with the extracellular space. The tips of the cone cells are not phagocytosed by the pig- ment cells. The body of the cone cell is connected at its inner end by the inner fibre to the expanded end, called the cone pedicle.  

#### Macula  
- The macula lutea (Latin for yellow) is an oval area at the posterior pole of the eye, roughly 3 mm lateral to the optic nerve head. It is responsible for central vision and measures 4.5 mm in diameter. Histologically, it is defined as the area in which the ganglion cell layer is more than one cell thick. Directly within the centre of the macula lies a pit in the con- tour of the retina, known as the fovea centralis. The fovea measures 1.5 mm in diameter and contains the most dense area of cone cells. Histologically, the fovea is defined as an area with an absent ganglion cell layer and a receptor layer composed entirely of cones. In cross-section the central trough of the pit displays only photoreceptor cells, where bipolar cells and their axons are swept aside in a radial fash- ion; this is known as the foveola.  

- The fovea contains an avascular zone which measures 500 μm across. This avascular zone can be displayed on flu- orescein angiography, and demarcates an area that must be avoided by laser treatment in conditions such as diabetic maculopathy.  

- The macula is not fully developed at birth, which explains, in part, the imperfect fixation at this stage.  

#### Retinal pigment epithelium  

- This consists of a simple layer of hexagonal cells that extends from the margin of the optic nerve to the ora ser- rata anteriorly.  

- The basal end of each cell is infolded and rests on Bruch’s membrane of the choroid.  

- The apical ends possess microvilli from 5 to 7 μm long, which project between and surround the outer segments of rods and cones, and there are no specialized attachments between them.  

- The microvilli are surrounded by a matrix of glucosami- noglycans, which act as a ‘glue’, binding the microvilli to the neural layer.  

- The basal regions are joined by zonula adherens and the apical cells are joined by zonula occludens, both of which sur- round the cells and join them tightly together. This is impor- tant in isolating the retina from the systemic circulation.  

- The apical microvilli continuously erode the tips of the photoreceptors and phagocytose the debris. This occurs in a cyclical fashion over a 24-hour period, with most of the sloughing of cells occurring in the morning. Lysosomes play an important role in breaking down the contents of the phagosomes and lipofuscin granules are the end result of this process.  

#### Blood supply  

- The central retinal artery is the first branch of the ophthal- mic artery (0.3 mm diameter). It runs forward adherent to the dural sheath of the optic nerve and enters inferior and medial to the optic nerve, 12 mm posterior to the eyeball. It first pierces the dura and arachnoid, from which it obtains coverings. It then turns 90° to enter the pia mater, acquiring another sheath. It then runs forward again to pierce the eye- ball. Here the posterior ciliary arteries form an anastomotic circle in the sclera around the optic nerve. A number of small anastomoses occur between branches of the posteri- or ciliary arteries and the central retinal artery. Occasionally a larger connection, known as the cilioretinal artery, exists between the two arterial systems.  

- The retinal arteries are distributed within the nerve fibre layer close to the internal limiting membrane. These arteries lose their internal elastic lamina after they bifurcate at the optic disc. They function as end arteries supplying all four quadrants of the retina and there are no arteriovenous anastomoses.  

- The arterioles travel in different layers of the retina, out as far as the inner nuclear layer. They do not anastamose but create capillaries. Non-fenestrated endothelial cells line the capillary walls. Whilst these capillaries are naturally absent in the foveal avascular zone, they are concentrated within the macula. Those cells external to the outer plexiform layer are supplied by the choroidal circulation. Those cells that are deep to the outer plexiform layer (i.e. the inner two-thirds) are supplied directly by the central retinal artery and its tributaries.  

- The blood–retinal barrier is maintained because of the zonula occludentes between the non-fenestrated retinal blood vessels and the zonula occludentes between the pig- ment epithelial cells of the retina.  

- The central retinal vein comprises tributaries that accom- pany arteries. Its diameter is a third to a quarter greater than that of the arteries. Arteries travel superficially to the veins and the veins eventually leave the eyeball through the lamina cribrosa accompanied by the central retinal artery. This then drains to the cavernous sinus or superior ophthal- mic vein.  

- There is no lymphatic drainage from the retina.
