On examination, the large pupil is clinically isolated. More commonly occurs in women and is associated with migraine, with nearly 50% having history of migraines. Aetiology is either parasympathetic insufficiency of the iris sphincter or sympathetic hyperactivity of the iris dilator (Jacobson DM. Benign episodic unilateral mydriasis. Clinical characteristics. Ophthalmology. 1995;102:1623–7)."
