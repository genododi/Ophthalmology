It also supplies the sphincter pupillae and the ciliary muscle with parasympathetic fibres.\n- The third nerve nuclei are situated in the midbrain at the level of the superior colliculus (Fig. 1.11). They contain two motor nuclei:\n- the main motor nucleus is situated in the anterior grey matter surrounding the cerebral aqueduct of the midbrain\n- the accessory parasympathetic nucleus (Edinger&#x2013;Westphal nucleus) lies posterior to the main motor nucleus. Preganglionic nerves travel to the orbit to synapse in the ciliary ganglion. Postganglionic fibres travel along short ciliary nerves to the ciliary muscles and sphincter pupillae of the iris. The accessory nucleus also receives:  \n- corticonuclear fibres for accommodation  \n- fibres from the pretectal nucleus for the direct and consensual light reflex.\n\n- The third nerve emerges anteriorly from the midbrain, medial to the cerebral peduncle, and enters the subarachnoid space. It continues anteriorly between the posterior cerebral artery and the superior cerebellar arteries. The nerve then runs parallel with the posterior communicating artery (Fig. 1.12).\n- The nerve perforates dura mata on the lateral side of the posterior clinoid process and enters the cavernous sinus wall running above the trochlear nerve (IV). - The nerve then passes forward, receiving two branches:\n- the sensory communicating branch from the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve.\n- the sympathetic branch from the nerve plexus around the internal carotid artery.\n\n- CLINICAL TIP  \n&gt; Internuclear ophthalmoplegia  \n&gt; Internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO) is a clinical manifestation of intrinsic brainstem disease. It is usually caused by demyelination or ischaemia. It has distinctive clinical features that indicate a lesion in the medial longitudinal fasciculus.  \n&gt; INO is seen as a lag of the adducting eye, with nystagmus of the abducting eye occurring on completion of a conjugate eye movement. The impairment of adduction is due to interruption of fibres in the MLF on the ipsilateral side. The nystagmus of the contralateral abducting eye is a jerk type, with fast phase away from the midline. The mechanism of nystagmus is not fully understood. Convergence may also be affected in INO.  \n&gt; In some patients, adduction may be normal on versions and slowing of adducting saccades may be the only clinical finding (saccades require higher frequency discharge).  \n&gt; In multiple sclerosis, the INO may be bilateral (BINO).
