It may be performed as an elective procedure to improve vision or as an emergency procedure for corneal perforation. It may involve full-thickness replacement of a button of corneal tissue (PK), partial-thickness replacement (lamellar keratoplasty), or of just the posterior layers (endothelial keratoplasty). Although not necessary for low-risk procedures, systemic immunosuppression should be considered for high-risk grafts."
