If there is a refractive error when viewing a distant object, the eye is described as ametropic. Ametropia can be divided into myopia (syn ‘short- sightedness’), hypermetropia (syn hyperopia; ‘long- sightedness’), and astigmatism (see Table 19.1). If there is no refractive error when viewing a distant object, the eye is said to be emmetropic (see Fig. 19.1)."

        "content": "Correction may be achieved using toric spectacle or contact lenses (different power in different meridians), CL, or refractive surgery. RGP CLs are particularly suited to the correction of astigmatism (including irregular astigmatism), since their rigidity allows the space between lens and cornea to become filled by the tear film to form a ‘lacrimal lens’ correcting even irregular astigmatism. This effectively neutralizes corneal astigmatism. In contrast, hydrogel (soft) CLs are less rigid and adopt the same shape as the cornea. Therefore, if a hydrogel CL is to be used to treat astigmatism, a toric design will be necessary. A certain degree of astigmatism may also be corrected as part of refractive surgery procedures."
