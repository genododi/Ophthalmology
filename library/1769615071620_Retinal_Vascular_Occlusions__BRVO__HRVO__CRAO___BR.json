HRVO has previously been classified as: (1) hemicentral RVO, in which the central retinal vein forms posterior to the lamina cribrosa from a dual trunk, with occlusion affecting a single trunk (thus a variant of CRVO); or (2) hemispheric RVO, in which a major branch of the central retinal vein is occluded at or near the optic disc (thus a variant of BRVO). However, use of this classification is limited by difficulty in identifying the site of occlusion in many cases of HRVO. Ischaemic hemispheric vein occlusions have an intermediate risk of rubeosis (compared with ischaemic BRVO and CRVO), but a greater risk of NVD than either ischaemic BRVO or CRVO. In the SCORE Study, HRVO was treated as BRVO and demonstrated a similar response to treatment (Scott IU et al. 2012)."
