Red (see Table 18.11) or watering eyes (see Table 18.12) are among the commonest ocular presentations in 1° care. Often these are relatively benign conditions, many of which may be successfully treated by GPs. However, in the presence of atypical features (particularly visual symptoms), more serious diagnoses should be considered. The presence of photophobia (also see Table 18.13) is usually an indication of more severe ocular pathology."
