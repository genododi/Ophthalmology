Assessment requires taking a history (visual/ birth/ developmental; see Table 17.4), appropriate measurement of vision, refraction, and ophthalmic examination (see Table 17.5), and consideration of any amblyogenic risk factors. A ‘squint’ may be the first presentation of serious pathology; either ocular (e.g. retinoblastoma, cataract) or non-ocular (eg. raised ICP), and thus careful ophthalmic examination (including dilated fundoscopy) and neurological examination is essential (see Boxes 17.1 and 17.2)."
