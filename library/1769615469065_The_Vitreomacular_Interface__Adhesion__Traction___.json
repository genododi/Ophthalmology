        "content": "The use of oCT has improved the understanding of the vitreoretinal interface tremendously. This complex junction between the vitreous and the retina is the cause of vitreomacular adhesion, vitreomacular traction, and macular holes. Vitreomacular adhesion is a condition where the normal PVD process is complicated by incomplete separation of the vitreous from the retina, combined with an abnormally strong adherence of the posterior hyaloid to the ILm. This adhesion normally does not cause any distortion in macular architecture. However, where the vitreous causes anteroposterior traction of the macular at adherent sites, there will be vitreomacular traction that causes alteration to the macular architecture."

Release of this traction by vitrectomy ± removal of tangential traction by ILm peeling appears to underlie the success of surgery in treating this condition. The developing idiopathic age-related macular hole may initially be asymptomatic but can cause progressive distortion of vision and a drop in acuity to 76/120. Worsening acuity approximately correlates with the pathological stages described by Gass. The newer classification system based on oCT anatomical findings have not been adequately correlated to surgical success yet."
