In essence, during the first 6y of life, our capacity for high-level vision is vulnerable. Anything less than perfect, balanced foveal images from both eyes can lead to loss of vision in one/ both eyes. With increasing age, this is harder to reverse and, by about 7– 8y of age, is usually permanent. The aetiology of amblyopia is related to interocular competitive disadvantage, thus bilateral foveal image deprivation is less amblyogenic than uniocular."
