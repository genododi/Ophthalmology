        "content": "PVD refers to separation of the cortical vitreous, along with the delineating posterior hyaloid membrane (PHM), from the neurosensory retina posterior to the vitreous base. PVD occurs due to vitreous gel liquefaction with age (synchysis) to form fluid-filled cavities (Fig. 16.15A) and subsequently condensation (syneresis), with access to the preretinal space allowed by a dehiscence in the cortical gel and/or PHM. It is usually a spontaneous event, but it can be induced by events such as cataract surgery, trauma, uveitis and panretinal photocoagulation."
