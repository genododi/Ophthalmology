Radiation retinopathy usually develops after a delay of 6mo–3y, which is thought to be the turnover time for retinal endothelial cells. Radiation-induced optic neuropathy occurs less frequently, with uncertain pathogenesis, but often results in blindness."

RP is a group of conditions characterized by progressive dysfunction, cell loss, and atrophy of retinal tissue. Photoreceptors are affected initially (rods in the first instance, with cone involvement in the later stages), with subsequent atrophy of other retinal layers, although the NFL is preserved till late in the disease process—which is exploited in retinal implant technology. The relative frequency of the different modes of inheritance differs widely in different series, but 750% of patients have no family history of RP. AD RP is often of later onset and less severe, whereas XL and AR disease is associated with an earlier onset and is more severe."
