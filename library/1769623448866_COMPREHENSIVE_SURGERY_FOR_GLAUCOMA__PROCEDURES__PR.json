        "content": "Surgery for glaucoma: Glaucoma surgery includes iris procedures (surgical iridectomy), angle procedures (goniotomy, trabeculotomy), filtration procedures (trabeculectomy, deep sclerectomy), minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS), and setons (tube drainage surgery). In adult glaucoma, the commonest operation and gold standard is trabeculectomy with adjuvant antifibrotic MMC. Augmentation with antifibrotics is indicated according to risk of fibrosis and filtration failure. Artificial drainage tubes (or setons) require considerable experience and are generally reserved for resistant cases. recent studies on 1° surgical treatment have compared trabeculectomy with tube surgery, but widespread adoption of 1° tube drainage surgery has not occurred. Surgical iridectomy and surgical cyclodialysis have become less common since the advent of yAG laser PI and cyclodiode. Goniotomy and trabeculotomy are generally restricted to congenital glaucoma (see E Glaucoma in children: assessment, pp. 894–5; E Glaucoma in children: treatment, p. 896).

Ciliary body shutdown: Post-op inflammation; treat with systemic/topical steroids and AC viscoelastic. Overfiltration: resuture scleral flap if early hypotony with maculopathy. Pupillary block: Perform new Nd-yAG PI + mydriatic-cycloplegic + steroids. Malignant glaucoma: Aqueous misdirection (short eyes); IOP can be normal in rare forms. Filtration failure: Obstruction internal (iris/vitreous), scleral (fibrin/blood), or external (tight sutures). COMPLICAt IONS OF P e N etr At ING P rOC e DU re S (1) 435"
