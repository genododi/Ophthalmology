It may be overlooked due to more obvious anterior scleral inflammation or because there is isolated posterior disease (40% of patients have no evidence of anterior scleral inflammation), and thus the eye appears white and quiet (often despite severe symptoms). It is associated with systemic disease (usually RA or systemic vasculitis (see Table 8.3)) in up to one-third of cases. Any posterior scleritis may lead to visual loss and needs to be treated seriously."
