Fluid may initially accumulate intracellularly in Müller cells, with subsequent rupture. Coalescence of smaller cavities may occur over time with subsequent progression to a foveal lamellar hole with irreversible impairment of central vision. CMO is a non-specific manifestation of any type of macular oedema."
