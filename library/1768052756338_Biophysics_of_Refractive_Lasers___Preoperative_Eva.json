Hypermetropic treatments: A ring-shaped area of mid-peripheral corneal tissue is removed to make the central cornea steeper (see Fig. 19.2b). Astigmatic treatments: Treatment with an elliptical or cylindrical beam which removes more tissue in the steeper meridian which is then flattened."

However, small treatment zones are associated with high degrees of haloes and glare, particularly with large pupil size. They are also associated with greater regression. Large treatment zones reduce visual symptoms and regression but are limited by requiring greater tissue removal. A compromise optical zone size of 76mm is normally used for removal."
