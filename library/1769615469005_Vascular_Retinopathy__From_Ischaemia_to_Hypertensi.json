The great majority of cases occur as a result of atherosclerosis of the carotid artery (common carotid or internal carotid); thus patients in their 60s and 70s, with other cardiovascular risk factors, are most commonly affected. greater than 90% stenosis of the ipsilateral carotid system is typically present; severe bilateral occlusion may sometimes occur. Rarely, OIS may occur due to trauma, dissecting aneurysms, or vascular inflammatory disease."
