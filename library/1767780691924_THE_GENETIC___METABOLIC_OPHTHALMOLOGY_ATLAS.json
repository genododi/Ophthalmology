Only half are XO (also known as 45,X), with 15% being mosaics and the remainder having partial deletions or other abnormalities. The Turner’s phenotype arises from XL genes that escape inactivation (e.g. the SHOX short stature homeobox gene). Other deletion syndromes: Although microdeletions are probably fairly common, macrodeletions, other than Turner’s, are rare. Syndromes with ophthalmic features include the cri-du-chat syndrome (5p−), DeGrouchy syndrome (18q−), and the 13q− deletion syndrome. Common features are hypertelorism and epicanthic folds. In addition, in 13q−, there is a significantly i risk of retinoblastoma."
