It is associated with systemic disease in around 50%, of which most cases are of a connective tissue disease. It is commonest in middle-aged women. Scleritis is bilateral in 50% of cases, but both eyes may not be affected at the same time (see table 8.2 for classification). Vision is often normal, and there is no discharge and no photophobia (unless there is an associated keratitis or anterior uveitis)."
