Doing this while maintaining the IoP elevated (e.g. by digital pressure on the globe) reduces risk of haemorrhage. It is not commonly done, as most buckling procedures can succeed without this manoeuvre. Drainage of SRF is sometimes combined with the injection of intravitreal air in the DACE (drain–air–cryotherapy–explant) procedure."

This enables the surgeon to perform the scleral buckling operation using the microscope and an indirect viewing system. The main concern that has been raised about this is that an extraocular operation is being converted into an intraocular operation."
