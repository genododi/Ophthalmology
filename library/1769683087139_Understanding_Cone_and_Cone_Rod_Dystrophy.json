As with other retinal dystrophies, the age of onset, severity and rate of progression can vary substantially. Affected individuals typically present with progressive loss of central vision, disturbance of colour vision and photophobia. The prognosis is usually poor, with an eventual visual acuity of 6/60 or worse."
