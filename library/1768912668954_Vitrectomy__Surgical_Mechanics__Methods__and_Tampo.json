Vitrectomy also allows surgical access to the retina to permit drainage of the SRF, removal of intraocular membranes, removal of retained lens fragments, removal of intraocular FBs, biopsy of subretinal lesions, and insertion of tamponade agents. Transconjunctival sutureless 23G, 25G, and 27G vitrectomy systems are gaining in popularity over 20G systems in most developed countries."
