VA outcomes are not statistically significantly better than manual techniques so far. There is a statistically significant improvement in FSL capsulotomy outcomes, compared to manual techniques, which would potentially benefit toric and multifocal lens insertion. A 2016 Cochrane review could not determine the equivalence or superiority of laser-assisted cataract surgery compared to standard manual phacoemulsification for multiple outcomes due to the low to very low certainty of the evidence available from existing studies.

MSICS has become the operation of choice in most parts of the world where phacoemulsification is not generally available for cost reasons. A number of trials of MSICS vs phacoemulsification have been performed, with a meta-analysis showing phacoemulsification to be slightly superior to MSICS in terms of uncorrected VA (with less surgically induced astigmatism); there were no significant differences in visual rehabilitation, endothelial cell loss, or complication rates between the two techniques.
