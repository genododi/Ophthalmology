Treatment is directed towards controlling the disease process, e.g. ocular lubricants for KCS. It is important to explain this to the patient, since it will seem counterintuitive to be treating a watery eye with drops. For MG disease, prescribe hot compresses, massage, lid cleaning ± lubricants/topical steroid/antibiotic/oral doxycycline. For crocodile tears (after VIIn palsy), botulinum toxin may be injected into the lacrimal gland; however, ptosis can occur as a complication of this. Lacrimal pump failure is usually a function of lid laxity and ectropion causing punctal eversion. This often leads to 2° punctal stenosis. Treatment is directed towards restoring the position of the lid and punctum, often with a lid shortening procedure."
