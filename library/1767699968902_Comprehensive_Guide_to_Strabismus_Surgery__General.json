These procedures adjust the effective pull of the muscle (by changing stretch and torque) and/ or direction of action. The aim is to produce eyes that are straight in the 1° position and downgaze while keeping the largest possible field of BSV. It may be necessary to sacrifice BSV in lower-priority gaze positions (e.g. upgaze) to achieve this (see Table 17.13)."

The commonest procedure is a unilateral ‘recess/ resect’, although the options range from single muscle procedures to bilateral (simultaneous or staged) surgery involving multiple muscles. ‘Recess/ resect’: An MR recession/ LR resection will turn the visual angles away from each other, whereas an LR recession/ MR resection will turn them towards each other. Estimation of the amount of surgical correction (in millimetres) required for the size of strabismus (in Δ) may be assisted by surgical tables. However, such tables are only a guide and should be modified by each surgeon, according to their own outcomes."
