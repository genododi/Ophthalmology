Acute progressive TeD is an ophthalmic emergency, as it may threaten the optic nerve and cornea (see Box 14.1). While most patients with TeD have clinical and/or biochemical evidence of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism, some are euthyroid—at least at the time of presentation. Thyroid dysfunction may precede, be coincident with, or follow TeD."
