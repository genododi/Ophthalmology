It usually requires removal of tractional forces by vitrectomy and membrane peel, or delamination followed by tamponade with either a long-acting gas or oil, if needed (retinal break). Surgery for TRD is based on the underlying cause. Vitrectomy with delamination, segmentation, and membrane dissection is the mainstay of treatment, particularly when the tractional detachment is 2° to PDR."
