        "content": "Chloroquine was used to prevent and treat malaria in the past, but is less often prescribed in recent times because of resistance to the medication. Hydroxychloroquine is used to treat long-term inflammatory disorders of the joints and skin. These medications are concentrated in melanin-containing structures of the eye, such as the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and choroid. Hydroxychloroquine is generally safe and cost effective but can cause permanent loss of vision because of retinal toxicity, particularly if the recommended dose is exceeded. Retinal adverse effects may be more common than previously believed and progression can occur despite discontinuation of the drug. Significant damage can occur without signs on fundus examination and optical coherence tomography (OCT) scanning of the macula has therefore emerged as a key part of screening. Renal impairment and the use of tamoxifen increases the risk of toxicity. Obesity may lead to miscalculation of the safe dose, as hydroxychloroquine is not stored in fat. Vortex keratopathy may occur (see above)."
