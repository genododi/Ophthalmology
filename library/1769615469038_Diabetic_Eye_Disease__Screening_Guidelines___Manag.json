Hence a national programme of digital photographic screening is under way. Photography could potentially be performed by mobile units, by selected 1°/2° care units, or by community optometrists. grading of the photographs could be performed by the same units (if approved) or the photographs could be sent to an approved centre. The UK National Screening Committee guidelines undergo regular revision and are available at: M https:// www.gov.uk/ topic/ population- screening- programmes/ diabetic-eye (see Table 13.7)."
