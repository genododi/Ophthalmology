Controversy continues regarding their long-term success rate, partly due to the long learning curve associated with these challenging techniques. It is likely that, in experienced hands, NPGS with augmentation can achieve similar long-term success to that seen with penetrating glaucoma surgery, but final IOPs are often higher than after augmented trabeculectomy surgery. Although NPGS has a lower rate of early hypotony after surgery, serious complications, including severe hypotony, endophthalmitis, and suprachoroidal haemorrhage, have all been described with NPGS."

However, the key feature is that Schlemm’s canal is then opened with a viscoelastic, which, it is argued, directly improves drainage by this route. The superficial scleral flap is tightly sutured to minimize filtration into the sub-tenon’s space, encouraging drainage into Schlemm’s canal.\n\nVariations: Antifibrotics and implants: as with deep scleretomy, both antifibrotics and implants may be used in viscocanalostomy."

It may be performed as an elective procedure to improve vision or as an emergency procedure for corneal perforation. It may involve full-thickness replacement of a button of corneal tissue (PK), partial-thickness replacement (lamellar keratoplasty), or of just the posterior layers (endothelial keratoplasty). Although not necessary for low-risk procedures, systemic immunosuppression should be considered for high-risk grafts."

Success depends on precise anatomical marking, thorough anterior vitrectomy, and meticulous management of the ocular surface to prevent long-term exposure of fixation materials."

However, small treatment zones are associated with high degrees of haloes and glare, particularly with large pupil size. They are also associated with greater regression. Large treatment zones reduce visual symptoms and regression but are limited by requiring greater tissue removal. A compromise optical zone size of 76mm is normally used for removal."

RGP CLs are particularly suited to the correction of astigmatism (including irregular astigmatism), since their rigidity allows the space between lens and cornea to become filled by the tear film to form a ‘lacrimal lens’ correcting even irregular astigmatism. This effectively neutralizes corneal astigmatism. In contrast, hydrogel (soft) CLs are less rigid and adopt the same shape as the cornea. Therefore, if a hydrogel CL is to be used to treat astigmatism, a toric design will be necessary. A certain degree of astigmatism may also be corrected as part of refractive surgery procedures."

Ametropia can be divided into myopia (syn ‘short- sightedness’), hypermetropia (syn hyperopia; ‘long- sightedness’), and astigmatism (see Table 19.1). If there is no refractive error when viewing a distant object, the eye is said to be emmetropic (see Fig. 19.1)."

Only half are XO (also known as 45,X), with 15% being mosaics and the remainder having partial deletions or other abnormalities. The Turner’s phenotype arises from XL genes that escape inactivation (e.g. the SHOX short stature homeobox gene). Other deletion syndromes: Although microdeletions are probably fairly common, macrodeletions, other than Turner’s, are rare. Syndromes with ophthalmic features include the cri-du-chat syndrome (5p−), DeGrouchy syndrome (18q−), and the 13q− deletion syndrome. Common features are hypertelorism and epicanthic folds. In addition, in 13q−, there is a significantly i risk of retinoblastoma."

The main causative organisms are once again staphylococci and streptococci. It is generally a much less severe disease, at least in adults and older children. In younger children, in whom the orbital septum is not fully developed, there is a high risk of progression and so should be treated similarly to orbital cellulitis (see Tables 18.27 and 18.28)."

In essence, during the first 6y of life, our capacity for high-level vision is vulnerable. Anything less than perfect, balanced foveal images from both eyes can lead to loss of vision in one/ both eyes. With increasing age, this is harder to reverse and, by about 7– 8y of age, is usually permanent. The aetiology of amblyopia is related to interocular competitive disadvantage, thus bilateral foveal image deprivation is less amblyogenic than uniocular."

Estimation of the amount of surgical correction (in millimetres) required for the size of strabismus (in Δ) may be assisted by surgical tables. However, such tables are only a guide and should be modified by each surgeon, according to their own outcomes."

A ‘squint’ may be the first presentation of serious pathology; either ocular (e.g. retinoblastoma, cataract) or non-ocular (eg. raised ICP), and thus careful ophthalmic examination (including dilated fundoscopy) and neurological examination is essential (see Boxes 17.1 and 17.2)."
