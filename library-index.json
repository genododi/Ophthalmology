          "content": "Chloroquine was used to prevent and treat malaria in the past, but is less often prescribed in recent times because of resistance to the medication. Hydroxychloroquine is used to treat long-term inflammatory disorders of the joints and skin. These medications are concentrated in melanin-containing structures of the eye, such as the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and choroid. Hydroxychloroquine is generally safe and cost effective but can cause permanent loss of vision because of retinal toxicity, particularly if the recommended dose is exceeded. Retinal adverse effects may be more common than previously believed and progression can occur despite discontinuation of the drug. Significant damage can occur without signs on fundus examination and optical coherence tomography (OCT) scanning of the macula has therefore emerged as a key part of screening. Renal impairment and the use of tamoxifen increases the risk of toxicity. Obesity may lead to miscalculation of the safe dose, as hydroxychloroquine is not stored in fat. Vortex keratopathy may occur (see above)."

Coalescence of smaller cavities may occur over time with subsequent progression to a foveal lamellar hole with irreversible impairment of central vision.

In adult glaucoma, the commonest operation and gold standard is trabeculectomy with adjuvant antifibrotic MMC. Augmentation with antifibrotics is indicated according to risk of fibrosis and filtration failure. Artificial drainage tubes (or setons) require considerable experience and are generally reserved for resistant cases. recent studies on 1° surgical treatment have compared trabeculectomy with tube surgery, but widespread adoption of 1° tube drainage surgery has not occurred. Surgical iridectomy and surgical cyclodialysis have become less common since the advent of yAG laser PI and cyclodiode. Goniotomy and trabeculotomy are generally restricted to congenital glaucoma (see E Glaucoma in children: assessment, pp. 894–5; E Glaucoma in children: treatment, p. 896).

This complex junction between the vitreous and the retina is the cause of vitreomacular adhesion, vitreomacular traction, and macular holes. Vitreomacular adhesion is a condition where the normal PVD process is complicated by incomplete separation of the vitreous from the retina, combined with an abnormally strong adherence of the posterior hyaloid to the ILm. This adhesion normally does not cause any distortion in macular architecture. However, where the vitreous causes anteroposterior traction of the macular at adherent sites, there will be vitreomacular traction that causes alteration to the macular architecture."

Release of this traction by vitrectomy ± removal of tangential traction by ILm peeling appears to underlie the success of surgery in treating this condition. The developing idiopathic age-related macular hole may initially be asymptomatic but can cause progressive distortion of vision and a drop in acuity to 76/120. Worsening acuity approximately correlates with the pathological stages described by Gass. The newer classification system based on oCT anatomical findings have not been adequately correlated to surgical success yet."

Treatment is directed towards controlling the disease process, e.g. ocular lubricants for KCS. It is important to explain this to the patient, since it will seem counterintuitive to be treating a watery eye with drops. For MG disease, prescribe hot compresses, massage, lid cleaning ± lubricants/topical steroid/antibiotic/oral doxycycline. For crocodile tears (after VIIn palsy), botulinum toxin may be injected into the lacrimal gland; however, ptosis can occur as a complication of this. Lacrimal pump failure is usually a function of lid laxity and ectropion causing punctal eversion. This often leads to 2° punctal stenosis. Treatment is directed towards restoring the position of the lid and punctum, often with a lid shortening procedure."

HRVO has previously been classified as: (1) hemicentral RVO, in which the central retinal vein forms posterior to the lamina cribrosa from a dual trunk, with occlusion affecting a single trunk (thus a variant of CRVO); or (2) hemispheric RVO, in which a major branch of the central retinal vein is occluded at or near the optic disc (thus a variant of BRVO). However, use of this classification is limited by difficulty in identifying the site of occlusion in many cases of HRVO. Ischaemic hemispheric vein occlusions have an intermediate risk of rubeosis (compared with ischaemic BRVO and CRVO), but a greater risk of NVD than either ischaemic BRVO or CRVO. In the SCORE Study, HRVO was treated as BRVO and demonstrated a similar response to treatment (Scott IU et al. 2012)."

RP is a group of conditions characterized by progressive dysfunction, cell loss, and atrophy of retinal tissue. Photoreceptors are affected initially (rods in the first instance, with cone involvement in the later stages), with subsequent atrophy of other retinal layers, although the NFL is preserved till late in the disease process—which is exploited in retinal implant technology. The relative frequency of the different modes of inheritance differs widely in different series, but 750% of patients have no family history of RP. AD RP is often of later onset and less severe, whereas XL and AR disease is associated with an earlier onset and is more severe."

In younger children, in whom the orbital septum is not fully developed, there is a high risk of progression and so should be treated similarly to orbital cellulitis (see pp. 884–5 and Table 14.4)."

It is usually a spontaneous event, but it can be induced by events such as cataract surgery, trauma, uveitis and panretinal photocoagulation."

Vitrectomy also allows surgical access to the retina to permit drainage of the SRF, removal of intraocular membranes, removal of retained lens fragments, removal of intraocular FBs, biopsy of subretinal lesions, and insertion of tamponade agents. Transconjunctival sutureless 23G, 25G, and 27G vitrectomy systems are gaining in popularity over 20G systems in most developed countries."

Controversy continues regarding their long-term success rate, partly due to the long learning curve associated with these challenging techniques. It is likely that, in experienced hands, NPGS with augmentation can achieve similar long-term success to that seen with penetrating glaucoma surgery, but final IOPs are often higher than after augmented trabeculectomy surgery. Although NPGS has a lower rate of early hypotony after surgery, serious complications, including severe hypotony, endophthalmitis, and suprachoroidal haemorrhage, have all been described with NPGS."

However, the key feature is that Schlemm’s canal is then opened with a viscoelastic, which, it is argued, directly improves drainage by this route. The superficial scleral flap is tightly sutured to minimize filtration into the sub-tenon’s space, encouraging drainage into Schlemm’s canal.\n\nVariations: Antifibrotics and implants: as with deep scleretomy, both antifibrotics and implants may be used in viscocanalostomy."

These devices target Schlemm’s canal, the suprachoroidal space, and the sub-tenon’s space. MIGS devices can be used alone or in combination with phaco cataract surgery. However, IOP reduction achieved with the use of these devices are less than IOP reduction achieved with trabeculectomy. Therefore, at present, their role is in the management of early to moderate glaucoma, and their role in advanced disease has not been defined."

MSICS has become the operation of choice in most parts of the world where phacoemulsification is not generally available for cost reasons. A number of trials of MSICS vs phacoemulsification have been performed, with a meta-analysis showing phacoemulsification to be slightly superior to MSICS in terms of uncorrected VA (with less surgically induced astigmatism); there were no significant differences in visual rehabilitation, endothelial cell loss, or complication rates between the two techniques.

Ametropia can be divided into myopia (syn ‘short- sightedness’), hypermetropia (syn hyperopia; ‘long- sightedness’), and astigmatism (see Table 19.1). If there is no refractive error when viewing a distant object, the eye is said to be emmetropic (see Fig. 19.1)."

RGP CLs are particularly suited to the correction of astigmatism (including irregular astigmatism), since their rigidity allows the space between lens and cornea to become filled by the tear film to form a ‘lacrimal lens’ correcting even irregular astigmatism. This effectively neutralizes corneal astigmatism. In contrast, hydrogel (soft) CLs are less rigid and adopt the same shape as the cornea. Therefore, if a hydrogel CL is to be used to treat astigmatism, a toric design will be necessary. A certain degree of astigmatism may also be corrected as part of refractive surgery procedures."

Only half are XO (also known as 45,X), with 15% being mosaics and the remainder having partial deletions or other abnormalities. The Turner’s phenotype arises from XL genes that escape inactivation (e.g. the SHOX short stature homeobox gene). Other deletion syndromes: Although microdeletions are probably fairly common, macrodeletions, other than Turner’s, are rare. Syndromes with ophthalmic features include the cri-du-chat syndrome (5p−), DeGrouchy syndrome (18q−), and the 13q− deletion syndrome. Common features are hypertelorism and epicanthic folds. In addition, in 13q−, there is a significantly i risk of retinoblastoma."

In essence, during the first 6y of life, our capacity for high-level vision is vulnerable. Anything less than perfect, balanced foveal images from both eyes can lead to loss of vision in one/ both eyes. With increasing age, this is harder to reverse and, by about 7– 8y of age, is usually permanent. The aetiology of amblyopia is related to interocular competitive disadvantage, thus bilateral foveal image deprivation is less amblyogenic than uniocular."

Estimation of the amount of surgical correction (in millimetres) required for the size of strabismus (in Δ) may be assisted by surgical tables.
