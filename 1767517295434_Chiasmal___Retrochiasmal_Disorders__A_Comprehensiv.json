It lies in an anatomically crowded region, so chiasmal syndromes may be accompanied by other neurological or endocrine abnormalities. The commonest and best known disorder of the chiasm is a pituitary adenoma causing bitemporal hemianopia; however, a wide range of other lesions and clinical presentations may be seen."
