# Wavelength
"The wavelength, λ, of a wave is the distance between two successive peaks of propagation. One oscillation is defined as the segment of the wave where it returns to the start, which is also known as one cycle. The amplitude is the maximum displacement of the wave from its baseline. If two waves are travelling together but their waves do not line up, they are 'out of phase'. Light waves that are out of phase are termed 'incoherent' whereas those that are in phase are termed 'coherent'.

## Interference
Interference is the phenomenon where two or more waves interact with one another. Constructive interference occurs when two or more waves that are in phase summate to form a new wave of amplitude equal to the sum of the initial waves. Destructive interference occurs when the waves are out of phase by half a cycle. Here two waves of equal amplitude will summate to produce a resultant wave of zero amplitude. This occurs in the corneal stroma where the collagen fibrils are evenly spaced such that light deviated by them is eliminated by destructive interference.

## Diffraction
Diffraction is described as the apparent bending of a wave around an obstacle. This causes a secondary wave front that is of a different phase and lower intensity to that of the initial wave prior to diffraction. Diffraction through a circular aperture causes a diffraction pattern where there is a central bright disc (the Airy disc) that is surrounded by alternating light and dark rings, together known as the Airy pattern. The size of the aperture affects the size of the Airy disc: the smaller the aperture the larger the disc. This is because diffraction is most prominent in smaller apertures. Diffraction occurs in all optical instruments, for example cameras and the human eye. Thus, when the pupil of the eye is at its smallest, diffraction is the main cause of image imperfection."

# Properties of light
"Physical optics studies interference, diffraction, polarization, and other phenomena in which light is treated as a wave. In contrast, geometric optics approximates light as a ray and is primarily concerned with the imaging properties of lenses and mirrors. Light may be described as discrete packets (quanta) of energy or a wave. The human eye is sensitive to a small proportion of the electromagnetic spectrum, lying between X-rays and microwaves, termed visible light. This area is subdivided into seven wavebands:

1. ultraviolet C (UVC, 200–280 nm)
2. ultraviolet B (UVB, 280–315 nm)
3. ultraviolet A (UVA, 315–400 nm)
4. visible light (400–780 nm)
5. infrared A (IRA, 780–1400 nm)
6. infrared B (IRB, 1400–3000 nm)
7. infrared C (IRC, 3000–10,000 nm)

The cornea and sclera absorb all the incident radiation at short wavelengths (UVB and UVC) and long wavelengths (IRB and IRC). UVA is strongly absorbed by the lens. Visible light freely passes through the ocular media. The longer wavelength IR that reaches the retina can have thermal effects, e.g. in a solar eclipse, causing retina burns. There is also evidence that the shorter wavelength UVA light can cause damage to the retina in aphakic or pseudophakic patients. Colour vision is perceived by three populations of cone receptors, each with a different peak spectral sensitivity. It is the relative stimulation of these that results in the perception of colour vision. This is described in Chapter 2. Light can be described as having two defining characteristics: wave behaviour and particle behaviour. More likely, however, there is no discrimination between the two, but rather a flux between two states, also known as the wave-particle duality.

## Wave theory of light
Light travels as waves, although its path is often represented as a 'ray'."

# The measurement of light
"Consider that light travels from a point source and is reflected off a surface. There are several ways to quantify light at various stages along this path. The radiometric system quantifies light in the entire electromagnetic spectrum as an absolute value. The photometric system is only concerned with quantifying light in the visual spectrum as a function of the visual response it produces. The different ways of measuring light are:

- **Radiant flux** (measured in watts) is the radiometric equivalent of luminous flux (measured in lumens), which is photometric, and quantifies how much light is emitted from a point source. A luminous flux of one lumen per square metre corresponds to a luminance of one apostilb.
- **Radiant intensity** (the equivalent of luminous intensity) considers the intensity of light in a given solid angle.
- **Irradiance** (the equivalent of illuminance) is the amount of light falling on a given surface area.
- **Radiance** (measured in watts per steradian) and luminance (measured in candelas) is the amount of light reflected per solid angle per area.

The unit known as the troland is a measure of retinal illumination when a surface luminance of one candela per square metre is viewed through an entrance pupil that measures one square millimetre after correction for the Stiles–Crawford effect. Geometric optics describes light propagation as a 'ray'. The concept of light as a ray allows for the construction of ray models, which may be used to describe how light propagates through an optical system and ignores the effect of diffraction. Geometric optics uses geometric principles to describe images and the properties of lenses and mirrors."

# Limit of resolution and resolving power
"The limit of resolution is defined as the smallest angle of separation between two points such that the two points are clearly visible as separate. The limit of resolution is achieved when two Airy discs are separated so that the middle of the second disc falls on top of the first dark ring of the first disc. The resolving power of the eye is measured with visual acuity tests. This is discussed in Chapter 2.

## Polarization of light
Light emitted from a source occurs in all directions at random. Polarization refers to the unification of light waves perpendicular to the direction of propagation. Polarized light can be formed from non-polarized substances, e.g. crystalline minerals. Light is also polarized on reflection off a plane surface, e.g. water, if the angle of incidence equals the polarizing angle of the plane surface.

## Birefringence
This is the property whereby light waves may pass undeviated if in one plane, but not in a plane perpendicular to this. Quartz crystals show this property. Because they split incident unpolarized light into two polarized beams travelling in different directions, they have two refractive indices.

## Dichroism
This is the property whereby light waves not aligned with the structure of a molecule are completely blocked. Only one beam of polarized light emerges. Tourmaline and Polaroid are dichroic substances, Polaroid being used in sunglasses. Polarizing glasses may be used to dissociate the eyes when assessing binocular vision (the Titmus test)."

# Reflection
## Reflection on an uneven surface
"A lot of the materials we come into contact with are not perfect mirrors, but they still reflect light so that we are able to see them; their surface is irregular and causes diffuse reflection.

## Reflection involving spherical reflecting surfaces
Spherical mirrors present themselves in a variety of everyday situations as well as within ophthalmological instruments. The Helpful hint box runs through some of the terminology used when describing spherical reflecting surfaces.

### A spherical mirror may be convex or concave
#### Concave mirrors
Parallel rays represent the object at a distance of infinity. Parallel rays to the principal axis are reflected towards the principal focus and the images produced are always real (Fig. 8.3)."

"There are two important laws that define reflection (Fig. 8.1):

1. The incident ray, the normal (the imaginary line that is perpendicular to the reflecting surface at the point of reflection), and the reflected ray all occur in the same plane or medium.
2. The angle of incidence (i) = the angle of reflection (r).

### Reflection at a plane mirror
The brain assumes that an object is positioned in the direction from which the light enters the eye. In Fig. 8.2 it can be seen that light from the object appears to come from the image when reflected in a plane mirror. However, this is an image that is erect, virtual, and laterally inverted.

### Rotation of a plane mirror
If a mirror is rotated, the angle of reflection moves by twice the angle of rotation of the mirror."

### Calculating the focal length, f:
where v is the image distance, u is the object distance, f is the focal length, and r is the radius.

As a general rule of thumb, any focal point that is inferred by re-tracing a ray diagram usually produces a virtual image.

### Magnification
Magnification, mathematically, is the ratio between the object size (o) and the image size (i); therefore  M = -v / u


# HELPFUL HINT
## Terminology for spherical reflecting surfaces
The centre of curvature (C) represents the centre of the sphere of which the mirror is made.  
The pole of the mirror (P) is the centre of the reflecting surface.  
The principal axis is the radius of curvature (CP), which is a line passing through the centre of curvature to the pole of the mirror.  
The principal focus (F) is the real or virtual intersect of parallel rays (to the principal axis) reflecting off the mirror.

203

## Constructing ray diagrams
In all cases the same principles are true:  
"The object may be outside the centre of curvature, at the centre of curvature, or within the centre of curvature (Fig. 8.4)."

1. Draw a line from the top of the object through the mirror to the centre of curvature in one continuous straight line (O–C–M).
2. Draw a parallel line (to the principal axis) to the mirror, and depending on the nature of the mirror (convex or concave) draw the reflected ray (away or towards the principal axis respectively).
3. At the point of reflection draw a straight line through the principal focus, F. Where the two rays intersect is the top of the image (M–F–1).

### Convex mirrors
Parallel rays to the principal axis are reflected away from the principal focus and a virtual image is produced behind the mirror by extrapolating the reflected rays.

### Focal length
In both convex and concave mirrors the distance between the principal focus and the pole of the mirror is the focal length, FP. In perfectly spherical mirrors the focal length, f, is half the radius.

# Refraction
"Refraction is a change in the direction of light when it passes from one transparent medium to another. The denser the medium, the slower the light passes through it. On striking an interface, the first edge of the beam to reach the dense medium is slowed first and this causes the beam to deviate. The last edge of the beam to reach the denser medium continues at the same velocity. As with reflections, the incident ray and the refracted ray all lie in the same plane. A classic example of refraction is the straw in a glass of water—the image looks jilted due to refraction at the water–air interface.

## Absolute refractive index
The absolute refractive index n is defined as:  absolute refractive index = velocity of light in vacuum / velocity of light in medium


of light passes through a pane of glass. Glass can therefore be used as an image splitter (Fig. 8.5). Reflected light is used in the teaching mirror of an indirect ophthalmoscope.

## Refraction at a curved interface
Refraction at a curved interface obeys Snell’s law, but the action can either converge or diverge light depending on the ratio of n1 to n2. For example, in a convex interface where n1 < n2 (such as air:cornea) the light is focused onto a point (Fig. 8.6). However, if n1 > n2 (glass:air) then light diverges away from the principal axis."

204

"When light enters a medium of higher refractive index it is 'bent' towards the normal; the opposite will occur if the light were to leave the denser medium for a less dense medium.

## Snell’s law
The incident light makes an angle (i) with the normal and the refracted ray forms an angle (r) with the normal. These angles can be worked out if the refractive indices (RIs) are known using the following formula according to Snell’s law:"

## Image splits
allowing view  
for both examiner and trainee

RI = sin i / sin r = n2 / n1

where i is the angle of incidence, r is the angle of refraction, and n is the refractive index of the media involved when light travels through n1 into n2. In fact, at each interface, around 4% of incident light is reflected and 96% is transmitted. Hence, only around 92%"

![Refraction of light at a convex refracting interface](Fig_8_6.jpg)  
*With permission from Louise Bye.*

The refracting power of a spherical surface is given by the equation:  surface power (dioptres) = (n2 - n1) / r

where r is the radius of curvature. Surface power is seen in the air:cornea example and accounts for the majority of the refraction occurring in the eye. Objects placed in an optically dense medium are viewed as distorted when seen from a less dense medium, like that of a straw in a glass of water; the image seems closer (Fig. 8.7).

## The critical angle and total internal reflection
A ray that strikes the surface of the water from underneath passes through undeviated. As the rays pass through more obliquely, they become more deviated. Eventually, the emerging ray runs parallel to the surface of the water. The incident angle for light rays when this happens is called

![Real and apparent depth](Fig_8_7.jpg)  
*With permission from Louise Bye.*

the critical angle. It depends partly on the refractive indices of the two media. At larger incident angles, light will fail to emerge from the water and this is termed 'total internal reflection'. For the water:air interface, the critical angle is 48.5° and for the glass:air interface the critical angle is 41°. Optical instruments rely on this principle in prisms, fibre-optic cables, and gonioscopy. Gonioscopy can allow visualization of the drainage angles. Usually, rays from the angle do not leave the eye because of total internal reflection. This is overcome by using a contact lens with a coupling agent such as saline or viscotears. It can also be used to view the peripheral retina. Chapter 10 contains images of ophthalmic instruments.

## Dispersion
Light is made up of many component wavelengths. The RI of any medium differs slightly for light of different wavelengths. Shorter wavelengths (blue) are deviated more than longer ones (red). The angle between the red and blue light is the dispersive power of a material and is not related to the RI. This is the basis for the chromatic aberration that affects optical systems and the eye."

205

# Prisms
"A prism is a transparent optical element with flat, polished surfaces that are inclined at an angle to each other such that the prism refracts light. The angle (α) between the two surfaces is called the refracting angle or apical angle of the prism."

"The orientation of the prism is described by the position of its base. Light passing through the prism obeys Snell’s law and thus light is deviated towards the base (Fig. 8.8). The total change in angle is the angle of deviation (D). D depends on:"

## Prism
![Passage of light through a prism](Fig_8_8.jpg)

![The Prentice position of a prism](Fig_8_10.jpg)  
*With permission from Louise Bye.*

"such as prism bars, it is the power in the position of minimum deviation that is specified. Prisms cannot be stacked as the incident light will not enter at the correct angle and the sum of the prisms will not equal the effective power of the prisms together. A horizontal and vertical prism may be stacked, however, and the diagonal power is calculated using Pythagoras’ theorem (the square of the diagonal equals the sum of the squares of the vertical and horizontal sides). A Risley prism used in conjunction with a Maddox rod to measure phorias is an example of this.

## Notation of prisms
The power of any prism can be expressed in various ways.

## Use of prisms
Prisms are used extensively in the diagnosis and measurement of ocular motility problems. Therapeutic prisms can be used for convergence insufficiency to improve fusional reserve. Prisms are base-out during exercise periods. Prisms are also used to relieve diplopia in decompensated heterophorias, small vertical squints, and some paralytic squints. Prisms can be permanently incorporated into glasses or Fresnel prisms can be stuck to an existing pair of glasses for immediate or temporary relief of diplopia."

## Prism

- the refractive index of the prism material
- the refracting angle, α, of the prism
- the angle of incidence (i) of the ray considered.

For any prism, D is least when the angle of incidence equals the angle of emergence. Refraction is now symmetrical and the angle is known as the angle of minimum deviation. Here the angle of deviation = (n – 1)α, where n is the refractive index of the medium. This means that the angle of deviation will be half that of the refracting angle for a glass prism with refractive index 1.5. A 1 prism dioptre power prism with a refracting angle of 1° produces an angle of apparent deviation of 1/2°. The image formed by a prism is erect, virtual, and displaced toward the apex of the prism (Fig. 8.9). The prism can also be put in the Prentice position. Here, one surface is perpendicular to the incident ray of light, so all deviation takes place at the second surface of the prism. In this position, the prism is of greater power than in the position of minimum deviation because in the Prentice position the angle of incidence does not equal the angle of emergence (Fig. 8.10). Glass ophthalmic and trial frame lenses are normally prescribed in the Prentice position. However, for plastic prisms"

# HELPFUL HINT
## Notation of prisms
The Prism dioptre (∆): a prism of 1 prism dioptre power (1∆) produces a linear apparent displacement of 1 cm of an object situated at 1 m.  
The angle of apparent deviation is the angle of apparent displacement of the object. A prism of 1 prism dioptre power produces an angle of apparent deviation of 1/2°.

# CLINICAL TIP    CLINICAL TIP
## Diagnostic prisms
- Measure angle objectively by prism cover test.
- Measure angle subjectively by Maddox rod.
- Measure fusional reserve to assess binocular vision.
- Measure microtropias using the 4-dioptre prism test.
- Assessment of simulated blindness.

## Prismatic correction
When prescribing prisms the correction is normally split between both eyes.  
- To correct convergence (esotropia) = base-out prism.
- To correct divergence (exotropia) = base-in prism.
- To correct vertical deviation = prisms are opposite for the two eyes, e.g. RE base-down, LE base-up for an R hypertropia.

# Spherical lenses
"A lens can be defined as a transparent optical medium that allows for the convergence or divergence of light rays to form an image. Lenses can take several forms, but if a refracting surface forms part of a sphere they are known as spherical lenses. Essentially, spherical lenses can fall into two major categories:

1. Convex lenses: these cause the convergence of incident light.
2. Concave lenses: these cause the divergence of light.

A plane surface can be thought of as a sphere with a radius of curvature of infinity. The total vergence power of a thin lens is the magnitude by which the lens can either converge or diverge light. It is defined as the sum of the two surface vergence powers. In thick lenses, the thickness of the lens must also be taken into account. By convention the vergence powers (Fig. 8.11) are designated as positive for convex lenses and negative for concave lenses. Fig. 8.11 is a ray diagram illustrating the vergence power of thin convex and concave lenses. In Fig. 8.12 the nature of the lenses AB is simplified to arrows and brackets. The principal axis passes through the nodal/principal point, N, and the principal focus, F. Because the lenses are transparent and have the same medium either side of them, any light travelling in the opposite direction to convention will get refracted and have a principal focus. Therefore, in Fig. 8.13 there are two principal foci, F1 and F2. The first principal focus (F1) is the point of origin of rays of light which, after refraction, are rendered parallel. The distance from F1 to N is the first focal length, f1. Incident light parallel to the principal axis is converged to or diverged from the second principal focus, F2. The distance from F1 to N is the second focal length, f2. The position of F2 is positive if it lies to the right of N and"

"lenses are plus lenses (+) and concave or diverging lenses are minus (–) lenses."

![Vergence power of thin spherical lenses](Fig_8_11.jpg)  
*With permission from Louise Bye.*

F = 1 / f2

For example, for a convex lens of second focal length 20 cm:  
F = 1 / 0.20 = +5D

whereas for a concave lens of focal length 30 cm:  F = 1 / 0.30 = -3.33D

## Linear magnification
It can also be seen above that a convex lens has magnification. The image, I, subtends a larger angle at the eye than the object, so when the object is placed between the nodal point and the first principal focus the magnification is:  magnification = I / O = v / u

where I is the image size, O is the object size, v is the distance of the image from the principal plane, and u is the distance of the object from the principal plane. If the object is placed exactly at the first principal focus, the image is infinitely distant to the object. Both subtend the same angle at the lens. The angular magnification is therefore 1. This can be used practically and is known as a 'loupe' (Fig. 8.16). It allows viewing at a much closer distance than would be possible unaided because the near point of the eye in most adults is 25 cm because of a limitation of accommodation. As a result of this apparent closer viewing, the object subtends a greater angle at the eye and a larger image is thrown onto the retina. Here, an object can be moved from 25 cm to a position f: magnifying power (M) = apparent size of image/apparent size of object (at 25 cm):"

## Concave
![Cardinal points of thin spherical lenses](Fig_8_12.jpg)  
*With permission from Louise Bye.*

## The thin lens formula
The position of the image can be calculated as follows:  1 / v - 1 / u = 1 / f2


208

"M = tanθ2 / tanθ1"

"Here, v is the distance of the image from the principal point, u is the distance of the object from the principal point, and f2 is the second focal length. The image produced by a lens for a given object (Figs 8.14 and 8.15) can be constructed as follows:

1. A ray of light passes from the object through the nodal point, N, undeviated."

- tanθ1 = O / 0.25
- tanθ2 = O / f therefore:  M = (O / f) × (0.25 / O) = 0.25 / f


"2. A ray of light also passes along the principal axis undeviated.
3. A ray of light parallel to the principal axis, which reaches the principal plane and after this passes through (+) or away from (–) the second principal focus, F2."

- 1 / f = F dioptres therefore:  M = F / 4


## Lens power
A more powerful lens has a greater ability to converge or diverge light. The vergence power in dioptres (D) is the reciprocal of the second focal length (metres):"

"Hence an 8× loupe must have a power of 32 D.

## Lens decentration
Rays of light that approach a lens at its periphery are refracted towards or away from the principal axis. This is not constant"

209

"across the lens and the prismatic effect increases further out in the periphery of the lens. Use of a non-axial portion of the lens for prismatic effect is called decentration. This is the underlying mechanism for spherical aberration. The prismatic power can be calculated as follows:  

P = F × D

where P is the prismatic power in dioptres, F is the lens power in dioptres, and D is the decentration in centimetres away from the visual axis."

# Astigmatic lenses
"Meridians are used in optics to define a reference to the direction of astigmatism. Astigmatism is a difference in the degree of refraction in two or more meridians, producing two or more foci. Cylindrical and toric lenses are the two types of astigmatic lens.

## Cylindrical lenses
This type of lens contains part of a cylinder and one plane surface. A plane of light traversing the lens in the same plane"

"as the axis would pass through the lens unaltered. This is because a cylindrical lens has no power along its axis. Instead, the power of a cylindrical lens exists 90° to its axis. What is produced by these cylindrical lenses is a line image of a point object, O, which is known as the focal line (Fig. 8.17).

## The Maddox rod

![Image formation by a thin convex lens](Fig_8_14.jpg)

"lenses placed next to each other in a row. These cylindrical lenses may be put into a trial lens frame. To use the Maddox rod, a point source of light or spot light is placed in the distance so that incident light is parallel. The Maddox rod is then placed in front of the eye. The image that the patient sees is described as follows. Light in the plane of the axis of the cylinder is brought to a point focus by the eye. Several planes of light in the same cylindrical axis are brought to multiple foci by each cylinder creating a row of"

"dots. This row of foci is interpreted by the eye as a line of light lying 90° to the axis of the Maddox rod (Fig. 8.18). Light in the plane 90° to the cylinder power is brought into focus between the rod and the eye, and multiple planes of light are brought to multiple foci between the eye and the rod. This real image is well within the near point of the eye and the patient is therefore unable to distinguish a clear image. The light instead is scattered over a wide area in the retina and is interpreted as diffuse illumination."

"To summarize, placing the Maddox rod over an eye will cause the eye to see the distant spot light as a streak 90° to the cylindrical axes of the Maddox rod. The Maddox rod is used to test muscle imbalance by dissociating the eyes by presenting dissimilar images of the spot light in the background and the streak in the foreground. This establishes a muscular resting state to test."

![Image formation by a thin concave lens](Fig_8_15.jpg)

## Toric lenses
A toric surface is curved in two meridians. The meridians of minimal and maximal curvature are called the principal meridians. In ophthalmic lenses these lie exactly perpendicular to each other. The principal meridian of minimum curvature is the base curve. Toric lenses form two foci of images in planes that are perpendicular to each other. The image lies somewhere between the two in an arrangement called Sturm’s conoid. The plane where the two rods of light intersect is called the circle of least confusion."

"The lenses can be thought of as a sphere with an overlying cylinder. They can be written as a fraction with the spherical power as the numerator and the cylindrical power the denominator, e.g. a toric lens with power +2.0D"

# CLINICAL TIP
## Use of Maddox rod to test muscle balance
The Maddox rod is placed in front of the right eye (in the trial frame).  
A white spot of light is used in the light box and the ambient lighting is dimmed.  
The right eye will see a line of light that appears as a straight line perpendicular to the Maddox rod.  
The left uncovered eye will see a white spot of light in the light box.  
This in effect has dissociated the eyes as they see dissimilar images.  
To test for horizontal imbalance, the rod must be horizontal to give a vertical line of light.  
If the patient sees the line going through the spot, then s/he is orthophoric. If the line is to the left of the spot, the patient has exophoria (not tropia as the eyes are dissociated). If the line is to the right of the spot, the patient is esophoric. If the line is below the spot the patient has a right hyperphoria and if it is above the line the patient has a right hypophoria or left hyperphoria.  
It must be remembered that the eye behind the Maddox rod is moving in the opposite direction to that indicated by the red line. So, if it turns out in exophoria, the line will be seen in the nasal field and will appear to the left of the spot.  
Similarly, vertical imbalance may be measured. If the line is below the spot, the right eye is hyperphoric and vice versa."

# CLINICAL TIP
## Use of Jackson’s cross-cylinder
The cross-cylinder is used during subjective refraction. It is held first with its axis along the line of the trial cylinder in the frame as determined by retinoscopy. The cross-cylinder is rotated and the patient is asked which gives the clearer image. The axis of the trial cylinder is rotated in the trial frame slightly towards the axis of the same sign in the cross-cylinder. This is repeated until the rotation gives equally different vision in either direction.  
This cross-cylinder can also be used to work out the power of the cylinder. The cross-cylinder is first held with one axis and then the other in line with the trial cylinder. This increases or decreases the power of the trial cylinder.  
If retinoscopy does not reveal astigmatism, the cross-cylinder can be used to confirm this. It is held in four orientations: 90°, 180°, 45°, and 135°. If the patient does not volunteer an improvement in vision in any orientation, it can be assumed that no cylindrical correction is necessary."

## Toric transposition
If the denominator is given in a sign opposite to that of the base curve, then the formula must be rewritten because a plus cylinder cannot be transposed onto a minus cylinder. In this example, the cylinder is minus, as it is the base curve, so there is no problem. The formula +3.0DS/–2.0DC axis 180° with base curve +6D must be transposed because the base curve is the opposite sign to the cylinder that is to be projected onto it. To achieve this, the prescription must first be transposed to give:  
+1.0DS/+3.0DC axis 90° with base curve +6D"

"The base curve must remain the same, so the new prescription must be fitted to it. The power of the anterior spherical surface can be worked out by subtracting the base curve from the spherical power required of the lens:  
+1.0 - (+6.0) = -5.0DS  
The axis of the base curve can be specified. It must remain fixed at +6D and its axis will be perpendicular to the axis of the steeper meridian (because it is by definition the flatter meridian):"

## Identification and neutralization of lenses
Identifying lenses without equipment is frequently useful in clinical practice. When a lens is moved from side to side, the image moves with or against according to the optics of the lens, as shown above. A convex lens will give an 'against movement' and a concave lens will give a 'with movement'. If looking at a cross, astigmatic lenses will cause the lines of the cross to 'scissor'."

"Remember that the spectacles or test lens must be placed with the back surface towards the target as focimeters measure the back vertex power.

## Focimeters and astigmatism
In spherical lenses, the end point is seen as a focused ring of dots. The end point of one meridian in an astigmatic lens is seen as a focused collection of parallel lines (a stack of sticks). This represents the elongation of the ring of dots by the cylinder. The orientation of the focused parallel lines signifies the direction of the power as opposed to the axis of the cylinder. The instrument should then be adjusted to find the power and direction of the remaining meridian. This allows the user to create a power cross. For example, the above power cross is obtained by focimetry. The resultant prescription must then be:  
+2.0DS/–1DC × 180

## Focimeters and bifocals
The front vertex distance should in both near and distance zones be measured in bifocals, as the power of the near add is a function of the anterior surface. The near add is calculated as the positive difference between the power recorded at the near and distance zones.

## Focimeters and prisms
If a test lens contains a prism, the appearance of the target will be displaced because the image is inverted by the telescope. Thus, provided the instrument was correctly set at zero from the start, even if the target is sharp, the ring of dots will be displaced. The graticule within the telescope contains a rule, which may be aligned with the direction of displacement. Each step of displacement on the rule corresponds to one prism dioptre. Prismatic effect may also be produced by decentration of the optical centres. Decentration is very easy to miss if the optical centre is not marked. Here, the optical centre of the test lens must be clearly marked and compared with the patient’s inter-pupillary distance (IPD) in order to establish the magnitude of decentration prescribed. Otherwise, the spectacles will appear as any normal prescription until placed on the patient, where the line of sight doesn’t coincide with the optical centres of the lens. Prism power in optical decentration is given by the formula:  P = F × D


"where P is the prismatic power (in prism dioptres), F is the power of the test lens, and D is the distance of decentration (in centimetres).

## Automated focimetry
Here a computer measures the level of deflection of rays as they traverse the lens in order to establish the prescription. This deflection is dependent on the focal and prismatic power of the lens and the level of decentration from the optical centre. Four lines are projected through the lens and captured on a sensor. Knowing the original path and the level of deflection of the rays allows for the calculation of the spectacle prescription.

## Tinted lenses and filters
Tinted lenses can either reflect or absorb unwanted light in specific wavelengths. A good example is of UVA-, UVB-, and UVC-protected sunglasses or protective goggles in laser therapy. This technique can be applied to any undesired wavelengths. A neutral density tint reduces the transmission of all wavelengths by absorption and so does not alter the spectrum of light. Filters apply the same principle and wavelength selection and can be added to different optical devices as an adjunct. For example, most slit lamps contain a heat filter to protect the patient against the thermal effects of the infrared spectrum. Photochromic lenses change their transmission characteristics depending upon the intensity of incident radiation: the lens becomes darker in brighter light. Glass photochromic lenses comprise colourless silver halide crystals suspended in borosilicate. Electromagnetic energy dissociates the silver and halogen to cause darkening.

## Antireflective coatings
Coatings of different refractive index to the lens may be used to cancel out reflection. These coatings adjust reflected light such that they emerge at one half of the wavelength out of the phase than that of the incident ray, resulting in destructive interference. This is achieved by a coating of thickness that is one quarter of the wavelength of the undesired light. This produces a quarter phase shift on incidence and a further quarter shift on emergence. A coating with the thickness of half the undesired wavelength will produce constructive interference and a mirror effect."

# Aberrations of lenses
"In every optical system there is imperfection. It is important we understand these aberrations so that we may construct solutions."

## Chromatic aberrations
"Remember that white light consists of many wavelengths and that the longer the wavelength, the less it is deviated by"

"We may test the accuracy of a spectacle correction by ensuring that the appropriate colour of light is focused onto the retina. This is especially the case when too strong a negative lens has been used for a myopic eye, thus rendering the patient more hypermetropic. Patients often dislike this as they are forced to accommodate to overcome this and exhibit symptoms of strain. In this case, the duochrome test would have shown that the green panel was far clearer than the red and the necessary adjustments could then be made to allow the myope to see the red panel more clearly. Given that the patient needs only to indicate the position of the panel that is clearest, the duochrome can even be used with those who are colour blind.

## Spherical aberration
This refers to the prismatic effect of a spherical lens as discussed in optical decentration on p. 215. Here, if the incident light is further away from the principal axis, a stronger prismatic effect is exerted. This causes the peripherally dispersed light to disturb the clarity of the centrally focused rays, thus blurring the image.

## Correction of spherical aberration
Aplanatic surfaces are lenses by which the anterior, peripheral refracting curved surface is less than the central optical zone. This attempts to lessen the prismatic effect where it is most needed. Aspherical lenses employ the use of a weaker opposing lens of a different refractive index fused with a main lens. This way the refractive properties are relatively maintained but the peripheral prismatic effect, and therefore spherical aberration, is neutralized. Because doublets make use of different refractive media a combination of aspheric and achromatic lenses is common."

"a refracting medium. This dispersion phenomenon is known as chromatic aberration. When white light is incident on a simple spherical lens, the same chromatic aberration occurs and is more apparent the further away from the principal axis.

## Achromatic lens systems
The properties of dispersion and refraction are mutually exclusive and thus we may select materials that are of an appropriate refractive index but low in dispersion. By selecting a lens with a high refractive power and low dispersive power to counter a lens with a low refractive power and high dispersion, it is possible to cancel out the dispersive effects of the total optical system whilst maintaining the desired refractive properties.

## Chromatic aberration in the eye
In the eye, the dioptric difference between the dispersion of red versus blue light is approximately 2D (Fig. 8.23). Remembering that the human eye’s peak spectral sensitivity lies at 550 nm (green), the human retina is deliberately placed such that it is in between the dispersion of white light, i.e. between red and blue. This optimizes the best level of focus specifically for its peak spectral sensitivity. The pupil and the nucleus of the lens also help to minimize chromatic aberration.

## Duochrome test
The duochrome is a plate seen on many visual acuity charts. It appears as two coloured backlit panels one on top of the other, each with black letters. The top panel is red and the bottom is green. If you are emmetropic or rendered emmetropic, placing a +1D lens over the eye will shift the dispersed spectrum forward and the letters on the red panel become clearer, and vice versa with a –1D lens."

## Spherical aberration in the eye
There are four main ways that the eye can reduce spherical aberration.

- **Corneal solutions**: the cornea itself acts as an aplanatic surface whereby the central optical zone is steeper than that of the periphery. This decreases the vergence power at the periphery and lessens the prismatic effect.
- **Aperture solutions**: the pupil helps restrict the incident light into the para-axial zone of the lens, thus preventing the more aberrant prone peripheral rays. The pupil is most effective at 2–2.5 mm in diameter.
- **Lenticular solutions**: the natural lens has a central nucleus, which is of a higher refractive index than the cortical matter. This means that at the periphery, rays that are typically affected by a greater prismatic effect are balanced with a lessened refractive effect, thus reducing spherical aberration at the level of the lens.
- **Minimizing aberrant rays with the Stiles–Crawford effect**: the photoreceptors have a decreased response to light which is obliquely incident upon them. This means that the greatest response is likely to come from correctly refracted para-axial rays. This phenomenon is known as the Stiles–Crawford effect.

## Oblique astigmatism
All optical systems are typically designed to refract incident light, which occurs along the principal axis. If the incident light is oblique to the principal axis, a toric effect results. This is, naturally, directly proportional to the magnitude of the lens power and, as we know, this leads to the production of Sturm’s conoid (Fig. 8.24). We can replicate oblique astigmatism in real terms by making the line of sight oblique to the principal axis on a pair of glasses."

"This is to be distinguished from oblique astigmatism of the eye, in which the principal meridians do not lie at 90° and 180°, but remain mutually perpendicular. This effect is greater in more powerful lenses as they have a greater cylindrical effect. To overcome this, spectacles are made with a downward tilt (pantoscopic tilt), especially in the case of high prescriptions and in the near-reading portion, where the oblique astigmatism is more profound. Oblique astigmatism is also noted to be worse in biconvex or biconcave spectacle prescriptions. By using the equivalent meniscus form of the lens system, the oblique astigmatism is reduced. Best form spectacles employ vast data and tables to give the optimum configuration of anterior and posterior curvatures to reduce both spherical and oblique astigmatism. The eye reduces oblique astigmatism by:

- the aplanatic nature of the cornea
- the natural curve of the retina—this allows obliquely focused light to form a circle of least confusion on the retina in most angles

The fact that the peripheral retina is not intended for fine detail means that its oblique astigmatism has a minimal effect on vision.

## Coma
Coma is, loosely, a combination of oblique rays and spherical aberration. Light originating from points away from the visual axis pass obliquely through the centre and the periphery of a lens, causing two focal points to occur. This gives rise to the superimposition of a main image and a blurred, elongated image. A circular target will appear as an elongated shape, or coma. Coma is reduced in the eye by the restriction of rays to the principal axis and, like oblique astigmatism in the eye, the effect is often negligible."

217

![Oblique astigmatism. FH and FV represent the horizontal and vertical line foci of a Sturm’s conoid, respectively](Fig_8_24.jpg)  
*With permission from Louise Bye.*

## Distortion
"The same increased prismatic effect in the periphery of a lens can account for distortion of the edges of an object. When viewing a square, high-power convex lenses classically give rise to a pin-cushion distortion, forcing the edges of the square to bow inwards. A concave lens will produce the opposite effect, forcing the edges outward, which is known as barrel distortion."

## Curvature of field
"This is where a flat or plane target produces a three-dimensionally bowled image. The retina ingeniously accommodates for this by also being bowled. Note that this effect may take place in spite of having accounted for spherical aberration, oblique astigmatism, and coma."

# Optics of the eye
"The eye consists of several refracting surfaces and therefore the thin lens formulae as described above are insufficient to deal with the complexity of the eye as they consider refraction only at two lens surfaces. Thick lens calculations are required because the combined power of a thick lens is not simply the sum of the individual thin lenses. Thick lens theory is simplified here and a few new concepts must be introduced (Fig. 8.25).

- The principal axis is the horizontal line all the way across.
- P1 and P2 are the principal planes and the points at which they cross the principal axis are known as the principal points. The principal planes are perpendicular to the principal axis. A ray of light incident at a principal plane (P1) leaves the second principal plane (P2) at the same vertical distance from the principal axis. The exact position of the principal planes is derived from calculations using lens position, curvature, thickness, and refractive index.
- There are two nodal points, N1 and N2, in any optical system (which may lie at the same point). These lie on the optical axis and have the property that a ray passing through the anterior nodal point (N1) leaves the lens as if it has passed directly through the second nodal point (N2). It emerges from N2 at the same angle from the principal axis to that at which it originally approached N1. The nodal points lie on the principal points only when media on opposite sides of the lens are the same."

"- **The principal foci (F1 and F2)** mean the same as for thin lenses and the focal lengths (f1 and f2) are the distances between the principal planes to the focal points.
- **The nodal points, focal points, and principal points** are described as the cardinal points because together they fully describe an optical system.

## Equivalent power and back vertex power
It can be seen that the reciprocal of the posterior vertex power of the lens (PVFL) gives the posterior vertex power (or back vertex power). This differs from the equivalent power of the lens, which is calculated from the two surface powers and includes a correction for lens thickness. This difference between back vertex power and equivalent power is a cause of error when prescribing high-power spectacles or contact lenses. The back vertex power is important in the prescription of spectacles because this is the point at which parallel rays are brought to a focus—which should also correspond to the plane of the retina. Dispensing opticians correct for back vertex power when prescribing glasses, using mathematical tables that exist for this purpose.

## Refraction by the eye
Many attempts have been made to understand and model the optics of the human eye. Gullstrand (Professor of Ophthalmology, Sweden) developed a schematic eye that closely modelled the human eye, and won a Nobel Prize in 1911 for his work. The refracting surfaces that need to be considered in the eye are the precorneal tear film/anterior corneal surface, and the anterior and posterior surfaces of the lens. The posterior corneal surface is much less important"

"because of the very small difference in refractive index between the cornea and the aqueous. The Helpful hint box summarizes the refractive indices of the media of the eye and the schematic eye cardinal points (Fig. 8.26). Looking at the lowest part of the table in the Helpful hint box, the nodal points and the principal points do not lie at the same point. This is because the media on either side of the lens are not the same. The nodal points are placed around the posterior pole of the lens and, because the pupil only allows a small circular cylinder of light to enter, even a"

"plane. Note that the posterior focal point (F2) lies on the retina. Here, the eye is treated as having a single refracting power of +58.6D. In the aphakic eye, where the cornea is the only refractive element, the calculated power is +43D. The crystalline lens therefore has a power of +15D (58 – 43 = 15D). The cornea is much more powerful than the lens because of the air–fluid interface and the greater difference between the refractive index at either side of the cornea.

## Using the reduced eye, a retinal image can be drawn (Fig. 8.27).
P is the principal plane and R is the retina. The principal axis corresponds to the optical axis and is perpendicular to P and R. N is the nodal point and lies at the back surface of the lens. F1 is the anterior focal point of this optical system. F2 is the second principal focus and falls on the retina in the emmetropic eye. Two rays of light form this image: first, a ray passing through the one nodal point, undeviated; second, a ray parallel to the first, through the anterior focal point, F1, which continues parallel to the principal axis after refraction at the principal plane. The image size can be seen to be proportional to the angle subtended by the object at the nodal point (visual angle). As the object approaches, it will subtend a greater visual angle.

## Accommodation and accommodative convergence/accommodation ratio
The crystalline lens can increase its dioptric power by reducing ciliary muscle contraction on the zonular fibres. This allows the lens to assume a more spherical shape. Most change occurs at the anterior lens surface, which therefore moves forward slightly. This ability is called accommodation.

- **The far point (FP)** is the position of an object where its image falls on the retina in a relaxed eye. In emmetropia, this is infinity.
- **The near point (NP)** is the nearest point at which an image can be seen with maximal accommodation.
- **The range of accommodation** is the difference between the two.
- **The amplitude** is the difference in diopteric power. The diopteric value is the reciprocal of the near and far point distance. The amplitude is given by:"

This has only one nodal point and a single principal plane. Anterior and posterior focal lengths are adjusted around this new principal"

"- It is also assumed that using a –1D lens is equivalent to 1D of accommodation, whereas a +1D lens would reduce accommodation by 1D.

For a given fixation distance the AC/A ratio inferred from the effect of ophthalmic lenses may be readily ascertained from the simple formula:  AC/A = (∆o - ∆L) / P

where ∆o is the original horizontal deviation without a lens in place (in prism dioptres), ∆L is the horizontal deviation with a lens in place (in prism dioptres), and P is the power of the accommodation-inducing lens. For example, supposing the original deviation for a given fixation distance was an exodeviation of 2∆. If –2D lenses induced an esodeviation of 8∆, the AC/A ratio would be:  AC/A = (8 - (-2)) / 2 = 5/2

The gradient method gives an AC/A ratio that is less than the heterophoria method. This is largely due to the effects of proximal convergence.

## AC/A and age
AC/A ratios tend to increase with age given the decline of accommodation. However, patients tend to adapt by stopping short of overconverging as the stimulus of diplopia probably overrides the blur stimulus. Instead, the target is placed further and further away to account for the distancing near point. Clinically, a high AC/A ratio will present as a convergence excess esotropia where the eyes are straight for distance but converge excessively for near. This can be controlled with bifocal spectacles, which reduce the accommodation required for near and therefore the convergence. Surgical correction may also be performed in the most severe cases.

## Catoptric images (Purkinje–Sanson images)
These are an indirect method of measuring changes in lens configuration. They depend on the reflection from each refracting element. Four images are seen: anterior (I) and posterior corneal (II) surfaces and anterior (III) and posterior lens (IV) surfaces. In Fig. 8.28 the images are shown as seen by the examiner. Images I, II, and III are real, erect, virtual images as they reflect from a convex surface. Image IV is a real, inverted image as it is formed from a concave surface. The actual images appear further back/posterior to where they appear because of refraction of the reflected light. The first image is often used to study corneal curvature, using Placido’s disc or keratometry. It is also used when assessing strabismus."

"amplitude of accommodation (A) = 1 / NP – 1 / FP  
So, if NP = 5 (reciprocal of 0.25 m) and FP = 0 (reciprocal of infinity), then A = 4D.  
Therefore to focus from infinity to a point 25 cm from the eye, the eye must exert 4D of accommodation.  
The accommodative reflex involves accommodation as well as convergence and miosis. There is a link between accommodation and convergence—the accommodative convergence/accommodation ratio (AC/A ratio). The normal AC/A ratio is around 4:1. There are various ways of measuring this:

- the heterophoria method
- the gradient method
- the haploscopic method
- the fixation disparity method.

For simplicity we shall describe the first two, which are the most popular.

## The heterophoria method
This method measures the horizontal deviation in distance fixation (optical infinity) with any refractive error fully corrected, on the assumption that no accommodation is present under these conditions. The horizontal deviation is then measured at near distance (1/3 m or 3D) on the assumption that the convergence exerted is entirely by accommodation alone. Here, the AC/A ratio is given by the following equation:  

AC/A = IPD + (∆d - ∆n) / D

where IPD is the inter-pupillary distance in centimetres, ∆d is the prismatic horizontal deviation at distance (prism dioptres), ∆n is the prismatic horizontal deviation at distance (prism dioptres), and D is the dioptric equivalent of the near distance. Remember that the convention of sign for an exodeviation is (–) and for an esodeviation is (+). This is true for heterophoric and gradient methods.

## The gradient method
Arguably the most preferred method of AC/A measurement is via the so-called gradient method. The essential points are as follows:

- The drive to change accommodation is given by ophthalmic lenses as opposed to a change in viewing distance.
- It is assumed that the accommodative response to the lenses (and therefore the accommodative convergence produced) is linear within a certain range.
- For a fixed distance, a minus lens diverges light, forcing the lens to adapt by means of accommodation in order to maintain a sharp image, whilst plus lenses relax accommodation."

## P        R
"- **compound myopic astigmatism**—rays in all meridians focus in front of the retina.

## Anisometropia
When the refraction of two eyes is different, the condition is known as anisometropia. Large degrees of anisometropia (usually > 1D) are a common cause of amblyopia because accommodation is a binocular process and the eyes cannot accommodate by different amounts. The more hypermetropic eye usually becomes amblyopic. Myopic patients tolerate greater degrees of anisometropia.

## Far point
The far point of the eye is that position in which the image of an object falls on the retina of a relaxed eye. In emmetropia, parallel rays are focused to a point on the retina. In myopia, the eye is longer and light needs to be divergent on reaching the principal plane to be refracted to a point that is further behind the normal emmetropic principal plane, given the same refractive power of the eye. In hypermetropia, the eye is shorter and light needs to be convergent on reaching the principal plane to be refracted to a point that is in front of the normal emmetropic principal plane, given the same refractive power of the eye.

## Optical correction
Optical correction of ametropia is necessary to deviate the incoming parallel rays of light so that these rays may be focused correctly upon the retina. In Fig. 8.32 it can be seen that with correction, parallel rays of light are brought to correct focus on the retina when the convex (+) lens is placed in front of the eye. It can be seen that the far point of the eye must coincide with the focal point of the lens, i.e. the lens converges the incoming light so parallel rays converge to give incident light that"

If the principal meridians do not lie at 90° to each other, this is known as irregular astigmatism and cannot be corrected by spectacles. Astigmatism can be classified according to the position of light rays relative to the retina:

- **compound hypermetropic astigmatism**—all light rays focus behind the retina
- **simple hypermetropic astigmatism**—rays in one meridian focus on the retina and in the other focus lies behind the retina

"approaches the eye at the same incident angle. The lens refracts light so parallel rays converge sufficiently on passing through the lens to be directed to the far point rather than rays that were already converging. In myopia, a concave lens is used (–) so parallel rays are brought to correct focus on the retina when the lens is placed in front of the eye. It can be seen that the far point of the eye must also coincide with the focal point of the eye. The lens refracts light so parallel rays diverge sufficiently on passing through the lens, so that they appear as if they are coming from the far point of the eye as they were without correction (Fig. 8.33). In practice, lenses are held in spectacles. These usually sit around 14 mm in front of the cornea. Moving the lens to this position has a consequent effect on the position of the focal point of the lens. The lens power for spectacles has to be calculated based on the position at which they are placed.

## Back vertex distance
If a lens is moved away from the eye, the image moves forward in both convex and concave lenses. In a hypermetrope, the image falls behind the eye and the purpose of the lens is to move the image forward. Hence, when the lens is moved away from the eye, the image is moved further forward and the lens effectively increases. In myopes, however, the image falls before the eye and the lens throws the image backwards onto the retina. If the lens slips forward, the patient becomes myopic again and, for each forward movement, a stronger concave lens is needed. Myopes do not like their glasses slipping forward for this reason. A general formula to correct for the position of the lens relative to the eye applies to both concave and convex lenses as follows:  F2 = 1 / (f1 - d)

where F2 is the power of the lens (in dioptres) required at the new position, f1 is the focal length of the original lens in metres, and d is the distance moved in metres. This is equivalent to the following formula:  F2 = F1 / (1 - dF1)

where F1 is the dioptric power of the original lens. Practically speaking, a lens of power greater than 5D must be placed in the back of the trial frame because the"

## Spectacle magnification
Spectacle magnification (SM) is the corrected image size divided by the uncorrected image size. Relative spectacle magnification (RSM) is the corrected ametropic image size divided by the uncorrected emmetropic image size. In axial myopia, if the lens is worn at the anterior focal point of the eye, the image size is increased. If the spectacles are brought nearer to the eye, the RSM is greater than 1. In refractive ametropia, the image size with spectacles is never at unity, even at the anterior focal point of the eye. In refractive hypermetropia, the image size is increased (RSM > 1) and in myopia it is decreased (RSM < 1). The image can be made larger by bringing the lens nearer to the eye and made smaller by bringing it further from the eye."

"distance from the cornea makes a significant difference. If more than one lens is used, the higher power lens must be placed at the back of the trial frame. The examiner must state the distance of the lens in front of the eye (there is a scale on the side of the trial frame to help measure this), which is called the back vertex distance. For example, refraction shows that an aphakic patient requires a +15D lens at back vertex distance 14 mm. He needs a contact lens. What power should this be?  F2 = F1 / (1 - dF1)
F2 = +15 / (1 - (+0.014) × (+15))
F2 = 18.98D (rounded to 19D)


# Aphakia and intraocular lens selection
"In aphakia, there is no convex lens in the eye. Light is focused behind the eye and this state is equivalent to having a high refractive hypermetropia. The aphakic anterior focal length (FaphD = 23.23 mm) is greater than the emmetropic anterior focal length (Faph = 17.05 mm). Spectacle correction leads to an RSM of 1.36 when placed at the anterior focal point of the eye (23.2 mm in front of the principal plane). Spectacles are usually worn around 14 mm in front of the cornea and the RSM at this distance is 1.33. Contact lenses produce a relative spectacle magnification of 1.1. The RSM can be calculated as follows:  
AB = DE = emmetropic image size  
AC = DG = corrected aphakic image size"

"magnification. Here contact lenses or a secondary intraocular lens is required. In both, the images can be fused to restore binocular vision. Aphakic spectacles (usually +10.0D or more) cause aberrations, image distortion (pin-cushion effect), and a prismatic effect. Around the edge of their glasses, patients will have a ring scotoma and objects may appear and disappear into and out of this scotoma (‘jack in the box’ phenomenon) (Fig. 8.34). As the eye moves, the scotoma will also move. Patients cope with this problem by moving their heads instead of their eyes and restricting their gaze to a small axial zone. If an intraocular lens is to be inserted, several theoretical or empirical formulae have been used to predict intraocular"

"RSM = AC / AB = DG / DE  
As rays FemE and FaphG are parallel  
angle DFaphG = angle DFemE  
and  
DG / FaphD = DE / FemD  
DG / DE = FaphD / FemD = 23.23 / 17.05  
therefore 23.23 / 17.05 = 1.36.  
An RSM of 1.33 means that the image will appear one-third larger than normal. Objects appear closer because of the increased angle of the image subtended by the eye. As a result, Snellen acuity will improve. Contact lenses will improve this to a magnification of 1.1 and an intraocular lens to a magnification of 1.0. In a patient with unilateral aphakia, spectacles can be problematic because of the imbalance in"

"lens (IOL) power. The commonly used SRK empirically derived formula states that:  P = A - B(AL) - C(K)

where P is IOL power in dioptres, A is a constant which denotes the position of the lens in the eye (each make of lens is different), B is the multiplication constant for axial length, AL is the axial length in millimetres, C is the multiplication constant for the average keratometry reading, and K is the average keratometry reading in dioptres. The values of the multiplication constants are B = 2.5 and C = 2.9. If a refractive condition (R) different to emmetropia is required, this formula is changed to:  P = A - B(AL) - C(K) - D(R)

D is 1.25 if required IOL power is greater than 14D, or 1.0 if IOL power required is less than 14D. If a posterior chamber lens was planned but an anterior chamber lens had to be inserted for clinical reasons, the IOL power must be changed. A less powerful lens is needed because"

"the lens is further forward. The IOL power must be reduced by the difference between the A constants of the two eyes. The original SRK formula was not accurate for eyes of varying lengths. This was corrected for in the SRK II formula. For these formulae, the axial length of the eye and keratometry must be known. Corneal curvature may be measured with a keratometer (Chapter 10, p. 255) while the axial length may be measured with an A-scan (ultrasound). Axial length measurements must be performed along the visual axis of the eye. Errors will be magnified as the axial length is multiplied by 2.5 in the SRK formula. If axial length is different between the two eyes by more than 0.5 mm then this should be rechecked. Intraocular lens selection is a combination of science and art. Not all patients will be happy as emmetropes or –0.5 to –0.3 myopes. Important factors are the patient’s previous refractive experience (myopes prefer to remain slightly myopic) and the refractive condition of the fellow eye (anisometropia must be avoided)."

# Accommodative problems
"Accommodation is the mechanism by which we are able to adapt our focus from distant to near targets. We all require around 30% of accommodation to be kept in reserve in order to view near targets comfortably. As a person grows older, the degree to which s/he can accommodate lessens, and this is termed presbyopia. As an infant the magnitude of accommodation is up to 14D. This declines to around 1D by around 60 years of age with a more rapid decline noted at the age of 45 (here the adult is capable of around 4D of accommodation). The reason for this decline is likely to be twofold:

1. Lenticular and capsular rigidity reduces the degree by which the natural lens becomes convex.
2. Ciliary body weakens with age (noted at around 40 years of age).

The patient’s near point is the minimum distance a target may be viewed in metres and the reciprocal of this distance infers the amount of accommodation in dioptres the patient is using.

## Working out the presbyopic correction
There are many ways to quantify how much near prescription to give. One of the simplest methods is as follows. By using the near point of a patient, one can work out the necessary presbyopic correction. Remembering that in order for a patient to see a near target comfortably s/he must have a quarter of her/his accommodation in reserve, the presbyopic prescription becomes:"

"1 / 3 × 1 / patient near point (m) = 1 / 3 × near point (m)  
Thus if a person's near point is 33 cm, 1 / 3 × 0.33 m = 1D  
It is important to remember that a simple near add correction must be task specific and does not translate to a multitude of activities. Ascertainment of range is a useful method to prevent over addition. We first establish that the patient is able to read N5 at a comfortable distance, then establish whether a slightly larger font size is clear at arm’s length. If the patient is able to see clearly for both distances, the range is likely to provide satisfactory vision for most important distances.

## How presbyopia affects people with different refractive states
Hypermetropes are essentially always in a state of accommodation in order to maintain a focused target as without accommodation their focal point would lie behind the retina. It is easy to see why presbyopia affects the hypermetrope more profoundly. The amplitude of accommodation for hypermetropes is 3D. A hypermetrope of +3D prescription has a magnitude of accommodation of 6D to (i) neutralize the hypermetropia and (ii) bring a target at 33 cm into focus. Conversely, a –3D myope requires no accommodation to achieve clarity at 33 cm."

# Bifocals
"There are many types of bifocal lens, which differ in construction and form. The near addition relies on either an increased convexity or a higher refractive index to achieve an increased vergence for near objects. The near addition is often placed in a position that is inferonasal to the optical centre of the main lens. Remember that before prescribing a near addition, a careful history detailing the needs and activities of the patient is required. For example, a computer worker may require a large distance portion with an intermediate power near addition. A myope may wish to have a distance prescription and leave the near add as plano as s/he may be perfectly capable of reading without glasses."

"The typical configuration of a bifocal lens notes two key positions on the lens:

- the assumed intersection for the line of sight point for distance (LOSD)
- the assumed intersection for the line of sight point for near (LOSN).

## Problems with bifocals
There are many reasons why intolerance occurs in bifocals.

### Poorly fitted frames
Occasionally a pair of spectacles will not be tolerated as the near segment has been placed in an inappropriate position. The bifocal is usually created such that the LOSN is around 8 mm inferior and 2 mm nasal to the LOSD. The near segment itself should be placed so that it is comfortable to access but far enough away from the visual axis in primary gaze that it does not interfere with distance vision. The edge of the near section is usually lined up with the inferonasal corneal limbus.

### Prismatic effect
As with lens decentration, the prismatic effect is directly proportional to the power of the lens and how peripheral the incident light lies. The mutually distant zone from the two optical centres on a bifocal prescription is therefore where the most prismatic effect is exerted. We shall term this the near–distant junction. The near segment itself has its own independent prismatic effect as it carries the sum of the near correction and the main lens.

### Solutions to prismatic effect
If a spectacle lens provides any solution to a prismatic effect, the lens is known as a prism-controlled prescription. By bringing the two optical centres closer together, the prismatic effect can be reduced. In fused bifocals the button is placed near the LOSD, thus reducing the distance between the two optical centres. Furthermore the button may be shaped (as in B, C, and D shapes) to further reduce the distance between the optical centres. In monocentric glasses, the optical centres of the distant and near portions coincide at the near–distant junction, and thus prismatic jump is eliminated. In a hypermetropic correction the lower half may be considered as a base-up prism. A down curve segment exerts a base-down prism effect. When the two are brought together, they cancel out each other’s prismatic effect.

### Prismatic jump
Owing to the previously described prismatic effect, a patient will notice a sudden change or 'jump' when moving from the distance segment to the near segment. This is because there is a sudden change in prismatic effect, which leads to an"

"abrupt change in image position. As prismatic jump is essentially a function of the prismatic effect, it follows that the higher the refractive change the worse the jump.

## Anisometropia
If there is a significant discrepancy between the prescription of one eye and that of another, it follows that there will be a discrepancy between the resulting prismatic effects of each lens. For example, remember that the average patient is only able to tolerate up to 1.5D of vertical prismatic imbalance. If the patient is pushed beyond this due to high anisometropia and thus high prismatic imbalance, discomfort and diplopia will occur. Similarly, caution must be used in patients with asymmetrical vertical muscle restriction/imbalance. Prismatic correction in near adds may take two construction processes, either pre-cast or biprism. The biprism or 'slab off' process is particularly useful in high anisometriopia that induces vertical imbalance. To reduce an asymmetric prismatic effect, first add a corrective prism to both near and distance anterior surfaces in the least prismatic lens so that right and left are equal. The prism is then removed from the distance portion to leave a prism-corrected near segment.

## Oblique astigmatism
Remember that oblique lens astigmatism occurs when light travels through the lens obliquely (non-paraxial), creating an optical aberration. Oblique lens astigmatism is corrected for by accounting for the pantoscopic tilt. This is to be distinguished from oblique astigmatism of the eye, in which the principal meridians do not lie at 90° and 180° but remain mutually perpendicular.

## Hazards associated with bifocal use
The hazards of bifocals are primarily concerned with dangerous activities; these include:

- working at heights, which is a direct contraindication
- working with dangerous chemicals or hot objects
- vertigo.

# Trifocal and progressive addition lenses (varifocal) lenses
Nowadays the daily activities of the average patient are varied and so require a multitude of different viewing distances. Some patients may require a 'one lens fits all' solution. It is here that multifocal spectacles become relevant."

## Trifocal lenses
"Trifocals employ the use of an intermediate prescription catering for middle distances that exists as an extension of the near segment on the near–distant junction. However, the viewing distances tend to be a little rigid and there are now two prismatic jumps. Sometimes trifocals may be created to provide some degree of overlap but a perfect solution is never entirely possible. Similarly to ordinary bifocals, trifocals are not often tolerated in the cases of anisometropia or muscle imbalance, where prisms are required.

## Progressive addition lenses (varifocal)
These lenses provide a more continuous solution between the near and distance segments, allowing for all distances to be catered for. They employ a 'strip' of lens that is optically true and gradually alters in power when the eye moves from the distance segment to the near segment—this strip is also known as a power progression corridor (PPC). Progressive addition lenses vary in design between 'hard' and 'soft' designs. These terms refer to the width of the PPC in relation to the size of the distance and near zones, where the 'softer' the design, the smaller the distance and near segment, and the wider the PPC.

### Advantages of varifocal lenses
- There is no visible change between distance and near segments, which provides a better cosmetic appearance.
- The prismatic jump that is problematic in bifocals and trifocals is eliminated.
- All distances are catered for in seamless fashion.

### Disadvantages of varifocal lenses
- Optical aberration does occur in varifocal lenses. Astigmatism and aberration arise on either side of the PPC and become more profound when the line of sight is more horizontally deviated. This is especially difficult to neutralize in patients with already high astigmatism or in those requiring a more powerful near addition and provides a major reason for intolerance in these cases. In 'soft' and 'ultrasoft' designs, a wider PPC is afforded, which reduces size of the peripheral segments on either side. This, in turn, reduces the amount of aberration and astigmatism associated with the peripheral segments.
- The configuration or rate of graduation of the PPC is also important to take into account. Some users may find that the power of the near addition they often use for close work is uncomfortably low."

# Low visual aids
"Most low visual aids consist of some sort of magnifying aid. They act by increasing the angle subtended by the object at the eye and therefore produce an enlarged retinal image."

## The convex lens

"or with standard presbyopic reading correction. The power of the convex lens used (~ +5D) is less than a standard loupe (×8 = +32DS) and it acts simply as an augmented presbyopic correction. The object is placed between the lens and the first principal focus (F1). A magnified, virtual image is formed.

## The Galilean system
This consists of a convex (+) objective and a concave eyepiece (–), which are separated by the difference between"

"their focal lengths (see Fig. 8.35). It produces an erect magnified image that is not greatly affected in the periphery or by astigmatism.

## Limitations of optical magnifying devices
- High magnification results in a reduced field of view.
- The object has to be held close to the eye.
- Magnification means that depth of focus is reduced."
